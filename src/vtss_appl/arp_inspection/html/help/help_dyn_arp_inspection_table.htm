<h1>Dynamic ARP Inspection Table</h1>

<p>
  Entries in the Dynamic ARP Inspection Table are shown on this page.
  The Dynamic ARP Inspection Table contains up to 256 entries, and is sorted first by
  port, then by VLAN ID, then by MAC address, and then by IP address. 
  All dynamic entries are learning from DHCP Snooping.<br/>
</p>

<h2> Navigating the ARP Inspection Table</h2>
<p>
  Each page shows up to 99 entries from the Dynamic ARP Inspection table, default being 20, selected through the
  "entries per page" input field. When first visited, the web page will show the first 20 entries from
  the beginning of the Dynamic ARP Inspection Table.<br/>
  The "Start from port address", "VLAN", "MAC address" and "IP address" input fields allow the user to select the
  starting point in the Dynamic ARP Inspection Table.
  Clicking the <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button will update the displayed table starting from
  that or the closest next Dynamic ARP Inspection Table match. In addition, the two input fields will -
  upon a <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button click - assume the value of the first displayed entry,
  allowing for continuous refresh with the same start address.<br/>
  The <input type="button" value=" >> "/> will use the last entry of the currently displayed table as a basis for
  the next lookup. When the end is reached the text "No more entries" is shown in the
  displayed table. Use the <input type="button" value=" |<<"/> button to start over.
</p>
