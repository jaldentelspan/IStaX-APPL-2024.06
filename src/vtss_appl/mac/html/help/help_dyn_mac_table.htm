<h1>Dynamic MAC Table</h1>

<p>
  Entries in the <a href="glossary.htm#MAC_table" class="glossary">MAC Table</a> are shown on this page.
  The MAC Table contains up to <script type="text/javascript">document.write(configMacAddressMax);</script> entries, and is sorted first by
  <a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a>, then by MAC address.<br/>
</p>

<h2> Navigating the MAC Table</h2>
<p>
  Each page shows up to 999 entries from the MAC table, default being 20, selected through the
  "entries per page" input field. When first visited, the web page will show the first 20 entries from
  the beginning of the MAC Table. The first displayed will be the one with the lowest VLAN ID
  and the lowest MAC address found in the MAC Table.<br/>
  The "Start from MAC address" and "VLAN" input fields allow the user to select the starting point in the MAC Table.
  Clicking the <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button will update the displayed table starting from
  that or the closest next MAC Table match. In addition, the two input fields will - 
  upon a <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button click - assume the value of the first displayed entry,
  allowing for continuous refresh with the same start address.<br/>
  The <input type="button" value=" >> "/> will use the last entry of the currently displayed VLAN/MAC address
  pairs as a basis for the next lookup. When the end is reached the text "No more entries" is shown in the
  displayed table. Use the <input type="button" value=" |<<"/> button to start over.
</p>
