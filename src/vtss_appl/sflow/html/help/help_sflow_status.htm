  <h1>sFlow Statistics Help</h1>
  <p>
    This page shows receiver and per-port <a href="glossary.htm#sflow" class="glossary">sFlow</a> statistics.
  </p>

  <h2>Receiver Statistics</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Owner</dt>
    <dd>
      This field shows the current owner of the sFlow configuration. It assumes one of three values as follows:<br/>
      &bull; If sFlow is currently unconfigured/unclaimed, Owner contains <samp>&lt;none&gt;</samp>.<br/>
      &bull; If sFlow is currently configured through Web<span class="has_cli"> or CLI</span>, Owner contains <samp>&lt;Configured through local management&gt;</samp>.<br/>
      &bull; If sFlow is currently configured through SNMP, Owner contains a string identifying the sFlow receiver.<br/>
    </dd>

    <dt>IP Address<span class="has_dns">/Hostname</span></dt>
    <dd>The IP address<span class="has_dns"> or hostname</span> of the sFlow receiver.</dd>

    <dt>Timeout</dt>
    <dd>The number of seconds remaining before sampling stops and the current sFlow owner is released.</dd>

    <dt>Tx Successes</dt>
    <dd>The number of UDP datagrams successfully sent to the sFlow receiver.</dd>

    <dt>Tx Errors</dt>
    <dd>
