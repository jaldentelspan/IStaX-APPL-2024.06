<h1>Mirroring &amp; Remote Mirroring Configuration Table Help</h1>

<p> <a href="glossary.htm#mirroring" class="glossary">Mirroring</a> is a feature for switched port analyzer. The administrator can use the <a href="glossary.htm#mirroring" class="glossary">Mirroring</a> to debug
    <br> network problems. The selected traffic can be mirrored or copied on a destination port where
    <br> a network analyzer can be attached to analyze the network traffic.
</p>

<p> Remote Mirroring is an extend function of <a href="glossary.htm#mirroring" class="glossary">Mirroring</a>. It can extend the destination port in other switch.
    <br> So the administrator can analyze the network traffic on the other switches.
</p>

<p> If you want to get the tagged mirrored traffic, you have to set VLAN egress tagging as "Tag All" on the reflector port. On the other hand,
    <br> if you want to get untagged mirrored traffic, you have to set VLAN egress tagging as "Untag ALL" on the reflector port.
</p>

<h2>Session ID</h2>

<p> Select session id to configure. </p>

<h2>Mode</h2>

<p> To <b>Enabled/Disabled</b> the mirror or Remote Mirroring function.</p>

<h2>Type</h2>

<p> Select switch type.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Mirror</dt>
 <dd>
 The switch is running on mirror mode.
 <br> The <a href="help_mirror.htm#source_port">source port(s)</a> and <a href="help_mirror.htm#destination_port">destination port</a> are located on this switch.
 </dd>

 <dt>RMirror source</dt>
 <dd>
 The switch is a source node for monitor flow.
 <br> The <a href="help_mirror.htm#source_port">source port(s)</a>, <a href="help_mirror.htm#reflector_port">reflector port</a> are located on this switch.
 </dd>

 <dt>RMirror destination</dt>
 <dd>
 The switch is an end node for monitor flow.
 <br> The <a href="help_mirror.htm#destination_port">destination port(s)</a> is located on this switch.
 </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a></h2>

<p> The <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a> ID points out where the monitor packet will copy to.
    The default <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a> ID is 200.</p>

<h2><a name="reflector_port">Reflector Port</a></h2>

<p> The <b>reflector port</b> is a method to redirect the traffic to Remote Mirroring <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a>.
    Any device connected to a port set as a reflector port loses connectivity until the Remote Mirroring is disabled.
    <br> In the stacking mode, you need to select switch ID to select the correct device.
    <br> If you shut down a port, it cannot be a candidate for <b>reflector port</b>.
    <br> If you shut down the port which is a <b>reflector port</b>, the remote mirror function cannot work.

    <br><br> <strong>Note1: The <b>reflector port</b> needs to select only on <b>Source</b> switch type.</strong>
    <br><br> <strong>Note2: The <b>reflector port</b> needs to disable MAC Table learning and STP.</strong>
    <br><br> <strong>Note3: The <b>reflector port</b> only supports on pure copper ports.</strong>
