<h1>QoS Weighted Random Early Detection Help</h1>

<div id="help_wred_v1" style="display:none;">

<p>This page allows you to configure the Random Early Detection (RED) settings for queue 0 to 5.</p>

<p>RED cannot be applied to queue 6 and 7.</p>

<p>Through different RED configuration for the queues it is possible to obtain Weighted Random Early Detection (<a href="glossary.htm#WRED" class="glossary">WRED</a>) operation between queues. </p>

<p>The settings are global for all ports in the <span class="SPOM_only">stack.</span> <span class="Standalone_only">switch.</span></p>

<p>The displayed settings are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Queue</dt>
 <dd>The queue number (CoS) for which the configuration below applies.</dd>
 
 <dt>Enable</dt>
 <dd>Controls whether RED is enabled for this queue.</dd>
 
 <dt>Min</dt>
 <dd>Controls the lower RED threshold.
     If the average queue filling level is below this threshold, the drop probability is zero.
     This value is restricted to 0-100.</dd>
 
 <dt>Max DP 1</dt>
 <dd>Controls the drop probability for frames marked with <a href="glossary.htm#dpl" class="glossary">Drop Precedence Level</a> 1 when the average queue filling level is 100%.
     This value is restricted to 0-100.</dd>
 
 <dt>Max DP 2</dt>
 <dd>Controls the drop probability for frames marked with Drop Precedence Level 2 when the average queue filling level is 100%.
     This value is restricted to 0-100.</dd>
 
 <dt>Max DP 3</dt>
 <dd>Controls the drop probability for frames marked with Drop Precedence Level 3 when the average queue filling level is 100%.
     This value is restricted to 0-100.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>RED Drop Probability Function</h2>
<p>The following illustration shows the drop probability function with associated parameters.</p>

<img src="/images/qos_wred.png" width="715" height="403" border="0" alt="RED Drop Probability Function"> 

<p>Max DP 1-3 is the drop probability when the average queue filling level is 100%. Frames marked with Drop Precedence Level 0 are never dropped.
Min is the average queue filling level where the queues randomly start dropping frames.
The drop probability for frames marked with Drop Precedence Level n increases linearly from zero (at Min average queue filling level) to Max DP n (at 100% average queue filling level).</p>

<p>The displayed settings are:</p>

<dl>

 <dd class="wred_v3_only" style="display:none;">The WRED group number for which the configuration below applies.</dd>

 <dt>Queue</dt>
 <dd>The queue number (CoS) for which the configuration below applies.</dd>

 <dt class="wred_v3_only" style="display:none;">DPL</dt>
 <dd class="wred_v3_only" style="display:none;">The Drop Precedence Level for which the configuration below applies.</dd>

 <dt>Enable</dt>
 <dd>Controls whether RED is enabled for this entry.</dd>

 <dt>Min</dt>
 <dd>Controls the lower RED fill level threshold.
     If the queue filling level is below this threshold, the drop probability is zero.
     This value is restricted to 0-100%.</dd>

 <dt>Max</dt>
 <dd>Controls the upper RED drop probability or fill level threshold for frames marked with
     <a href="glossary.htm#dpl" class="glossary">Drop Precedence Level</a> &gt; 0 (yellow frames).
     This value is restricted to 1-100%.</dd>

 <dt>Max Unit</dt>
 <dd>Selects the unit for Max. Possible values are:
     <br><samp>Drop Probability</samp>: Max controls the drop probability just below 100% fill level.
     <br><samp>Fill Level</samp>: Max controls the fill level where drop probability reaches 100%.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>RED Drop Probability Function</h2>
<p>The following illustration shows the drop probability versus fill level function with associated parameters.</p>

<img src="/images/qos_wred_v2.png" width="715" height="403" border="0" alt="RED Drop Probability Function">

<p>Min is the fill level where the queue randomly start dropping frames marked with Drop Precedence Level &gt; 0 (yellow frames).<br>
   If Max Unit is 'Drop Probability' (the green line), Max controls the drop probability when the fill level is just below 100%.<br>
   If Max Unit is 'Fill Level' (the red line), Max controls the fill level where drop probability reaches 100%.
   This configuration makes it possible to reserve a portion of the queue exclusively for frames marked with Drop Precedence Level 0 (green frames).
   The reserved portion is calculated as (100 - Max) %.<br>
   Frames marked with Drop Precedence Level 0 (green frames) are never dropped.<br>
   The drop probability for frames increases linearly from zero (at Min average queue filling level) to Max Drop Probability or Fill Level.</p>
