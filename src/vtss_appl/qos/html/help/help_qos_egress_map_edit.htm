<h1>QoS Egress Map Configuration Help</h1>

<h2>QoS Egress Map Configuration</h2>

<p>This page allows to edit or create a single QoS Egress Map entry at a time. Each entry has a key and an action.
  The key indicates which fields of the frame will be mapped to the fields specified by and according to the action. Each Map
  can hold a number of map rules, or mappings between possible keys and actions. Which of those rules will be applied depends
  on the selection of (Key-Type, Action-Type). Here it is possible to configure these 'filters'.
</p>

<h3>QoS Egress Map Parameters</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Map ID</dt>
  <dd>
    Indicates the Map (unique) ID. Range is <samp><span class="egressMapMin">?</span></samp> to <samp><span class="egressMapMax">?</span></samp>.
    When in edit mode, this is non-configurable. However, it is possible to overwrite an existing mapping through the create mode.
  </dd>

  <dt>Map Key</dt>
  <dd>
    Indicates the Key type that will be used to filter the map rules when applying the map. As mentioned above, map rules can have various keys
    and this is to make a select set of them. Possible Key types are:
    <br><samp>CoS ID</samp>: Use classified COS ID as key.
    <br><samp>CoS ID - DPL</samp>:Use classified COS ID and DPL as key.
    <br><samp>DSCP</samp>: Use classified DSCP as key.
    <br><samp>DSCP - DPL</samp>: Use classified DSCP and DPL as key.
  </dd>

  <dt>Map Action</dt>
  <dd>
    Indicates the Action type that will be used to filter the map rules when applying the map. As mentioned above, map rules can have various
    actions available and this is to make a select set of them. Possible Action types are:
    <br><samp>PCP</samp>: <a href="glossary.htm#PCP" class="glossary">Priority Code Point</a>.
    <br><samp>DEI</samp>: <a href="glossary.htm#DEI" class="glossary">Drop Eligible Indicator</a>.
    <br><samp>DSCP</samp>: <a href="glossary.htm#dscp" class="glossary">Differentiated Services Code Point</a>.
  </dd>
