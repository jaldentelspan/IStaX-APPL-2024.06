<p>Configure NTP on this page.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the NTP mode operation. Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable NTP client mode operation.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable NTP client mode operation.
 </dd>

<!--
 <dt>Polling Interval</dt>
 <dd>
   The switch is periodically transmitting NTP frames to its servers for having the network time information up-to-date. The interval between each NTP frame is
   determined by the <b>Polling Interval</b> value. Valid values are restricted to 4 - 14. The poll interval is a power of two seconds.
 </dd>
-->

 <dt>Server #</dt>
 <dd> 
 Provide the IPv4 or IPv6 address of a NTP server. IPv6 address is in 128-bit records represented as eight fields of up to four hexadecimal digits with a colon separating each field (:).
 For example, 'fe80::215:c5ff:fe03:4dc7'.
 The symbol '::' is a special syntax that can be used as a shorthand way of representing multiple 16-bit groups of contiguous zeros; but it can appear only once. It can also represent a legally valid IPv4 address. For example, '::192.1.2.34'.
 In addition, it can also accept a domain name address.
