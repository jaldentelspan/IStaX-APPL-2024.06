    <h1>Port Security Port Status</h1>
    <p>
      This page shows the MAC addresses secured by the Port Security module.
      Port Security may be configured both administratively and indirectly
      through other software modules - the so-called user modules. When a user
      module has enabled port security on a port, the port is set-up for
      software-based learning. In this mode, frames from unknown MAC addresses
      are passed on to the Port Security module, which in turn asks all user
      modules whether to allow this new MAC address to forward or block it.
      For a MAC address to be set in the forwarding state, all enabled user
      modules must unanimously agree on allowing the MAC address to forward. If
      only one chooses to block it, it will be blocked until that user module
      decides otherwise.<br/>
      Notice that if you have added static or sticky MAC addresses, they will
      show up on this page only if Port Security is enabled on the interface to
      which they pertain.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Delete</dt>
      <dd>
        Click to remove this particular MAC addresses from MAC address table.
        The button is only clickable if the entry type is Dynamic. Use the
        &quot;Configuration&rarr;Security&rarr;Port Security&rarr;MAC Addresses&quot;
        page to remove Static and Sticky entries.
      </dd>

      <dt>Port</dt>
      <dd>
        If all ports are shown (can be selected through the drop-down box on the
        top right), this one shows the port to which the MAC address is bound.
      </dd>

      <dt>VLAN ID &amp; MAC Address</dt>
      <dd>
        The VLAN ID and MAC address that is seen on this port. If no MAC
        addresses are learned, a single row stating
        <i>"No MAC addresses attached"</i> is displayed.
      </dd>

      <dt>Type</dt>
      <dd>
        Indicates the type of entry. Takes one of three values:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Dynamic</b>: The entry is learned through learn frames coming to the
            Port Security module while the port in question is not in sticky
            mode.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Static</b>: The entry is entered by the end-user through management.
            Entry is not subject to aging.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sticky</b>: When the port is in sticky mode, all entries that would
            otherwise have been learned as dynamic are learned as sticky.<br/>
            Sticky entries are part of the running-config and can therefore be
            saved to startup-config. An important aspect of sticky MAC addresses
            is that they survive link changes (in contrast to Dynamic, which
            will have to be learned again). They also survive reboots if
            running-config is saved to startup-config.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>State</dt>
      <dd>
        Indicates whether the corresponding MAC address is violating
        (administrative user has configured the interface in "Restrict" mode and
        the MAC address is blocked), blocked, or forwarding.
      </dd>

      <dt>Age/Hold</dt>
      <dd>
        If at least one user module has decided to block this MAC address, it
        will stay in the blocked state until the hold time (measured in seconds)
        expires. If all user modules have decided to allow this MAC address to
        forward, and aging is enabled, the Port Security module will
        periodically check that this MAC address still forwards traffic. If the
        age period (measured in seconds) expires and no frames have been seen,
        the MAC address will be removed from the MAC address table. Otherwise a
        new age period will begin.<br/>
        If aging is disabled or a user module has decided to hold the MAC
        address indefinitely, a dash (-) will be shown.
      </dd>
