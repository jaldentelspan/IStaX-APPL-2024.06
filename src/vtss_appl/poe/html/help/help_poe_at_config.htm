<h1>Power Over Ethernet Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect and configure the current <a href="glossary.htm#PoE" class="glossary">PoE</a> port settings.</p>

<h2>System Configuration</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Power Supply</dt>
 <dd class="has_backup">
    PoE power supply limit used by PoE, Values are in Watts.
</dl>

<dl>
 <dt>Capacitor Detection</dt>
<dd>Controls capacitor detection for legacy PD devices.
</dd>
<dd>Disabled:	This feature is disabled.
<dd>Enabled:    This feature is enabled.
</dl>

<dl>
 <dt>Interruptible power</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Controls if PoE power should be interrupted (operate self PoE restart) during unit software restart cycle, or remain
 unchanged during the unit software restart cycle.</p>
 <p><b>Disabled</b>: PoE power remains unchanged during the entire unit software restart cycle.</p>
 <p><b>Enabled</b>: PoE power to already powered PD devices will be restart which means turn off and then turn on all ports.
 cycle.</p>
 </dd>

<h2>Port Configuration</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   This is the logical port number for this row.
   <p>Ports that are not PoE-capable are not shown.</p>
 </dd>

 <dt>PoE Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>    The <b>Mode</b> represents the PoE operating mode  for the
 port.</p>
 <p><b>Disabled</b> : PoE disabled for the port. </p>
 <p><b>Standard</b> : Enables PoE IEEE 802.3at standard </p>
 <p><b>Plus</b>     : Enables PoH capabilities (around 45W for each pair) </p>
 </dd>

 <dt>Priority</dt>
 <dd>
    <p>The <b>Priority</b> represents the ports priority. There are three levels of power priority named Low, High and Critical.</p>
    <p>The priority is used in the case where the remote devices
  requires more power than the power supply can deliver. In this case the port with the lowest priority will be turn off starting from the port with the highest port number.</p>
 </dd>

 <dt>LLDP</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>The LLDP configures the PoE port behavior with respect to LLDP packets from PD.</p>
 <p><b>Enable</b> : PoE parameters as PD power-request received through LLDP are processed.</p>
 <p><b>Disable</b> : PoE parameters received through LLDP are ignored.</p>
 <p>LLDP protocol is configured by its own configuration web page and transmission of PoE information via LLDP can be
 configured with the LLDP-MED configuration page.</p>
 </dd>

 <dt>Cable Length</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Cable length assist port power optimization allocation to remote PD advertising their power requirement over
 LLDP. Cable power loss for PD Type4 requesting 71.3W is assumed to be 18.7W for 100m cable length. So port max power
 will be set to 90W. However if PD is located only 30 meter away then port maximum power can be lowered to 76W
 freeing 14W for other PDs.</p>
 <p><b>max10</b> :Ethernet cable length is 10 meter or less.</p>
 <p><b>max30</b> :Ethernet cable length is 30 meter or less.</p>
 <p><b>max60</b> :Ethernet cable length is 60 meter or less.</p>
 <p><b>max100</b> :Ethernet cable length is 100 meter or less.</p>
