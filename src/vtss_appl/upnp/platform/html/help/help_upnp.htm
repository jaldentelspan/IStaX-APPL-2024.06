<h1>UPnP Configuration Help</h1>

<h2><a href="glossary.htm#upnp" class="glossary">UPnP</a> Configuration</h2>

<p>Configure UPnP on this page.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the UPnP operation mode. Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable UPnP mode operation.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable UPnP mode operation.
 <br>When the mode is enabled, two ACEs are added automatically to trap UPNP related packets to CPU. The ACEs are automatically removed when the mode is disabled.
 </dd>

<dt>TTL</dt>
<dd>
    The TTL value is used by UPnP to send SSDP advertisement messages. Read only now.
</dd>

 <dt>Advertising Duration</dt>
 <dd>
    The duration, carried in SSDP packets, is used to inform a control point or control points how often it or they should receive an SSDP advertisement message from this switch. If a control point does not receive any message within the duration, it will think that the switch no longer exists. Due to the unreliable nature of <a href="glossary.htm#udp" class="glossary">UDP</a>, in the standard it is recommended that such refreshing of advertisements to be done at less than one-half of the advertising duration. In the implementation, the switch sends SSDP messages periodically at the interval one-half of the advertising duration minus 30 seconds.  Valid values are in the range 100 to 86400. Specified in seconds.
 </dd>

 <dt>IP Addressing Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 IP addressing mode provides two ways to determine IP address assignment:
 <br><samp>Dynamic</samp>: Default selection for UPnP. UPnP module helps users choosing the IP address of the switch device. It finds the first available system IP address.
 <br><samp>Static</samp>: User specifies the IP interface VLAN for choosing the IP address of the switch device.
 </dd>

 <dt>Static VLAN Interface ID</dt>
 <dd>
    The index of the specific IP VLAN interface. It will only be applied when IP Addressing Mode is static. Valid configurable values ranges from 1 to 4095. Default value is 1.
 </dd>
