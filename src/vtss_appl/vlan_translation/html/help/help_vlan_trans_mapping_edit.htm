<h1>Mapping Configuration Help</h1>
<p>This page displays current VLAN Translation mapping configurations. The settings can also be configured here.</p>

<dl>
  <dt >Group ID</dt>
  <dd>The VLAN Translation mappings are organized into Groups, identified by the Group ID.
      This way a port is configured to use a number of VLAN Translation mappings easily by simply configuring it to use a given group.
      Then number of possible groups in a switch is equal to the number of ports present in this switch. A port can be configured to use
      any of the groups, but only one at any given time. Multiple ports can be configured to use the same group.
      A valid Group ID is an integer value from <samp><span class="gidMin">?</span></samp> to
      <samp><span class="gidMax">?</span></samp>.<br />
      <b>Note:</b>
	    By default, each port is set to use the group with Group ID equal to the port number.
      For example, port #1 is by default set to use group with GID = 1.
  </dd>

  <dt>Direction</dt>
  <dd>Indicates the direction of the VLAN Translation and it refers to the switch. The direction can be 'Ingress', where
      the translation takes place on the VLAN ID of frames entering the switch port, 'Egress', where the translation
      takes place on the VLAN ID of frames exiting the switch port, or 'Both', where the translation takes place
      on both of the above directions.
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VID</a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates the VLAN ID of the mapping (i.e. 'source' VLAN). A valid VLAN ID ranges from <samp><span class="vidMin">?</span></samp> to
  <samp><span class="vidMax">?</span></samp>.
  </dd>

  <dt>TVID</dt>
  <dd>Indicates the translated VLAN ID to which a VLAN ID of a frame will be translated to.
      A valid translated VLAN ID ranges from <samp><span class="vidMin">?</span></samp> to
      <samp><span class="vidMax">?</span></samp>.
