<h1>VLAN Translation Mapping Table Help</h1>

<p>This page allows you to create mappings of VLANs -> Translated VLANs and organize these mappings into global Groups.</p>

<dl>
  <dt >Group ID</dt>
  <dd>The VLAN Translation mappings are organized into Groups, identified by the Group ID.
      This way a port is configured to use a number of VLAN Translation mappings easily by simply configuring it to use a given group.
      Then number of possible groups in a switch is equal to the number of ports present in this switch. A port can be configured to use
      any of the groups, but only one at any given time. Multiple ports can be configured to use the same group.
      A valid Group ID is an integer value from <samp><span class="gidMin">?</span></samp> to
      <samp><span class="gidMax">?</span></samp>.<br />
      <b>Note:</b>
	    By default, each port is set to use the group with Group ID equal to the port number.
      For example, port #1 is by default set to use group with GID = 1.
  </dd>

  <dt>Direction</dt>
  <dd>Indicates the direction of the VLAN Translation and it refers to the switch. The direction can be 'Ingress', where
      the translation takes place on the VLAN ID of frames entering the switch port, 'Egress', where the translation
      takes place on the VLAN ID of frames exiting the switch port, or 'Both', where the translation takes place
      on both of the above directions.
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VID</a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates the VLAN ID of the mapping (i.e. 'source' VLAN). A valid VLAN ID ranges from <samp><span class="vidMin">?</span></samp> to
  <samp><span class="vidMax">?</span></samp>.
  </dd>

  <dt>TVID</dt>
  <dd>Indicates the translated VLAN ID to which a VLAN ID of a frame will be translated to.
      A valid translated VLAN ID ranges from <samp><span class="vidMin">?</span></samp> to
      <samp><span class="vidMax">?</span></samp>.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Modification Buttons</h2>
<dl>
 <dd>
 You can modify each VLAN Translation mapping in the table using the following buttons:
 <br><img src="../images/edit.gif" alt="Edit">: Edits the mapping row.
 <br><img src="../images/del.gif" alt="Delete">: Deletes the mapping.
 <br><img src="../images/add.gif" alt="Add">: Adds a new mapping.
 </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p>Auto-refresh<input type="checkbox">: Check this box to refresh the page automatically. Automatic refresh occurs every <span class="refreshInterval">?</span> seconds.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" Refresh ">: Click to refresh the page.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" Remove All ">: Click to remove all VLAN Translation mappings.</p>
