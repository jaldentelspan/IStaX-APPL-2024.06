<h1>CFM Mep Configuration Help</h1>

<h2><a href="glossary.htm#CFM" class="glossary">CFM</a> MEP Configuration</h2>

<p>Configure CFM MEP parameters on this page.</p>

This switch supports two types of MEP: Port Down-MEPs and VLAN Down-MEPs.<br/><br/>

<u>Port Down-MEPs</u><br/>
In 802.1Q terminology, Port MEPs are located below the EISS entity, that is,
closest to the physical port. Port MEPs are used by e.g.
<a href="glossary.htm#APS" class="glossary">APS</a> for protection purposes.<br/>
Port MEPs are created when the encompassing service has type "Port".<br/>
Port MEPs may send OAM PDUs tagged or untagged. An OAM PDU will be sent untagged
only if the MEP's VLAN is set to "Inherit" (0). Any other value will cause it to
be sent tagged with the port's TPID, whether or not the VLAN matches the port's
PVID and that PVID is meant to be sent untagged.<br/><br/>

<u>VLAN Down-MEPs</u><br/>
in 802.1Q terminology, VLAN MEPs are located above the EISS entity.<br/>
This means that tagging of OAM PDUs will follow the port's VLAN configuration.<br/>
Thus, if a VLAN MEP is created on the Port's PVID and PVID is configured to be
untagged, OAM PDUs will be transmitted untagged.<br/>
VLAN MEPs are created when the encompassing service has type "VLAN".<br/><br/>

<u>Down-MEP creation rules</u><br/>
There are a few rules to obey when creating Down-MEPs:<br/>
&nbsp;1. There can only be one Port MEP on the same port.<br/>
&nbsp;2. There can only be one VLAN MEP on the same port and VLAN.<br/>
&nbsp;3. A VLAN MEP must have a higher MD/MEG level than a Port MEP on the same port and VLAN.<br/>
<span class="cfm_has_shared_mel">&nbsp;4. All Port MEPs must have the same MD/MEG level<br/></span>
<span class="cfm_has_shared_mel">&nbsp;5. Any VLAN MEP must have an ME/MEG level higher than a Port MEP<br/><br/></span>

These checks are performed automatically on administratively enabled MEPs when
you change a particular MEP, change the Service Type from Port to VLAN or vice
versa, or change the domain's MD/MEG level.<br/><br/>

<dl>
<dt>Delete</dt>
<dd>
Check to delete the entry. It will be deleted during the next save.
</dd>
<dt>Domain</dt>
<dd>
Name of Domain under which this MEP resides.
</dd>
<dt>Service</dt>
<dd>
Name of Service under which this MEP resides.
</dd>
<dt>MEPID</dt>
<dd>
The identification of this MEP. Must be an integer [1..8091]
</dd>
<dt>Direction</dt>
<dd>
Set whether this MEP is an Up- or a Down-MEP.
</dd>
<dt>Port</dt>
<dd>
Port on which this MEP resides.
</dd>
<dt>VLAN</dt>
<dd>
VLAN ID. Use the value 0 to indicate untagged traffic (implies a port MEP).. 
</dd>
<dt>PCP</dt>
<dd>
Choose PCP value in PDUs' VLAN tag. Not used if untagged.
</dd>
<dt>SMAC</dt>
<dd>
Set a Source MAC address to be used in CCM PDUs originating at this MEP. Must be a unicast address. Format is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX. If all-zeros, the switch port's MAC address will be used instead.
</dd>
<dt>Alarm Control</dt>
<dd>
<b>Level:</b> If a defect is detected with a priority higher than this level, a fault alarm notification will be generated.
<br>Valid range is [1; 6] with 1 indicating that any defect will cause a fault alarm and 6 indicating that no defect can cause a fault alarm.
See 802.1Q-2018, clause 20.9.5, LowestAlarmPri

<br>The possible defects and their priorities are:
<table summary="">
<tr><td>Short name  </td> <td>Description               </td> <td>Priority</td> </tr>
<tr><td>DefRDICCM   </td> <td>Remote Defect Indication  </td> <td>       1</td> </tr>
<tr><td>DefMACstatus</td> <td>MAC Status                </td> <td>       2</td> </tr>
<tr><td>DefRemoteCCM</td> <td>Remote CCM                </td> <td>       3</td> </tr>
<tr><td>DefErrorCCM </td> <td>Error CCM Received        </td> <td>       4</td> </tr>
<tr><td>DefXconCCM  </td> <td>Cross Connect CCM Received</td> <td>       5</td> </tr>
</table>

</dd>
<dd>
<br><b>Present:</b> The time in milliseconds that defects must be present before a fault alarm notification is issued. Default is 2500 ms.
</dd>
<dd>
<br><b>Absent:</b> The time in milliseconds that defects must be absent before a fault alarm notification is reset. Default is 10000 ms.
</dd>
<dt>State Control</dt>
<dd>
<b>CCM:</b> Enable or disable generation of continuity-check messages (CCMs)
</dd>
<dd>
<br><b>Admin:</b> Enable or disable this MEP. When this MEP is enabled, it will check received/missing CCMs and can raise defects.
</dd>
<dt>Remote MEPID</dt>
<dd>
Specify the Remote MEP that this MEP is expected to receive CCM PDUs from. Must be an integer [0..8091] where 0 means undefined. The value of Remote MEPID must be different from the value of MEPID.
</dd>
