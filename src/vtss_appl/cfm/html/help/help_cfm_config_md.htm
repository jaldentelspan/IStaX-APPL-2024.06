  <u>About leak prevention</u><br/>
  Leak prevention is about discarding OAM PDUs with MEG levels lower than the
  MEP they hit when the OAM PDUs are ingressing the port on which the MEP
  resides, and to discard OAM PDUs with MEG levels at or lower than the MEP's
  when the OAM PDUs are ingressing other ports.<br/>
  There are two categories of architectures, when it comes to leak-prevention:
  Those that use Shared MEG level and those that use Independent MEG level:<br/><br/>

  <u>Shared MEG level</u><br/>
  On Shared MEG level architectures, Port Down MEPs always perform level
  filtering no matter which VLAN ID (VID) OAM PDUs get classified to, unless the
  same port has a VLAN MEP on the VID in question. So if you have a Port MEP in
  VID X and a VLAN MEP in VID Y, an OAM frame arriving on the port and gets
  classified to VID X or VID Z will be handled/level-filtered by the Port MEP,
  whereas an OAM frame ingressing the port in VID Y will be handled by the VLAN
  MEP. Likewise, if the switch has a Port MEP on VID X on Port X and an OAM
  frame ingresses on VID Y on Port Y, it is subject to level filtering before
  egressing Port X, unless Port X also has a VLAN MEP on VID Y, in which case
  the VLAN MEP will take care of level-filtering the OAM PDU.<br/>
  On Shared MEG level architectures, all Port MEPs must have the same MEG level
  and any VLAN MEP must have a MEG level higher than the Port MEPs' MEG
  level.<br/><br/>

  <u>Independent MEG level</u><br/>
  On Independent MEG level architectures, Port Down MEPs never perform level
  filtering on frames not classified to the MEP's VID. So if you have a Port MEP
  on VID X and a VLAN MEP on VID Y and an OAM frame ingresses any port on VID Z,
  it is not subject to handling/level-filtering by any of the two MEPs.<br/><br/>
