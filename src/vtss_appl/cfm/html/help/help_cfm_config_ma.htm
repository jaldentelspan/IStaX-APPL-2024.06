<dl>
<dt>Delete</dt>
<dd>
Check to delete the entry. It will be deleted during the next save.
</dd>
<dt>Domain</dt>
<dd>
Name of Domain under which this Service resides.
</dd>
<dt>Service</dt>
<dd>
Name of Service. Value is a single word which begins with an alphabetic letter A-Z or a-z with length 1-15.
</dd>
<dt>Format</dt>
<dd>
Select the short Service name format. This decides how the value of the Name parameter will be interpreted. To mimic Y.1731 MEG IDs, create an MD instance with an empty name and use <samp>Y1731 ICC</samp> or <samp>Y1731 ICC CC</samp>.
<br>Possible values are:
<br><samp>String</samp>
<br><samp>Two Octets</samp>
<br><samp>Y1731 ICC</samp>
<br><samp>Y1731 ICC CC</samp>
<br>Look under <b>Name</b> for explanation.
</dd>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>
<br>The contents of this parameter depends on the value of the format member.
Besides the limitations explained for each of them, the following applies in general:
<br>If the Domain <b>Format</b> is <samp>None</samp>, the size of this cannot exceed 45 bytes.
<br>If the Domain <b>Format</b> is not <samp>None</samp>, the size of this cannot exceed 44 bytes.
<br>
<br>If <b>Format</b> is <samp>String</samp>, the following applies:
<br> length must be in range [1; 44] 
<br> Contents must be in range [32; 126]
<br>
<br>If <b>Format</b> is <samp>Two Octets</samp>, the following applies:
<b>Name[0]</b> and <b>Name[1]</b> will both be interpreted as unsigned 8-bit integers
(allowing a range of [0; 255]). <b>Name[0]</b> will be placed in the PDU before <b>Name[1]</b>.
<br>The remaining available bytes in name will not be used.
<br>
<br>If <b>Format</b> is <samp>Y1731 ICC</samp>, the following applies:
<br>  length must be 13.
<br>  Contents must be in range [a-z,A-Z,0-9]
<br> Y.1731 specifies that it is a concatenation of ICC (ITU Carrier Code) and UMC (Unique MEG ID Code):
<br>    ICC: 1-6 bytes
<br>    UMC: 7-12 bytes
<br>In principle UMC can be any value in range [1; 127], but this API does 
not allow for specifying length of ICC, so the underlying code doesn't know
where ICC ends and UMC starts.
<br>The Domain <b>Format</b> must be <samp>None</samp>.
<br>
<br>If <b>Format</b> is <samp>Y1731 ICC CC</samp>, the following applies:
<br> length must be 15.
<br> First 2 chars   (CC):  Must be amongst [A-Z]
<br> Next 1-6 chars  (ICC): Must be amongst [a-z,A-Z,0-9]
<br> Next 7-12 chars (UMC): Must be amongst [a-z,A-Z,0-9]
<br> There may be ONE (slash) present in name[3-7].
<br> The Domain <b>format</b> must be <samp>None</samp>.
</dd>
<dt>VLAN</dt>
<dd>
<br>The MA's primary VID. A primary VID of 0 means that all MEPs created within this MA will be created as port MEPs (interface MEPs). There can only be one port MEP per interface. A given port MEP may still be created with tags, if that MEP's VLAN is non-zero."
<br>A non-zero primary VID means that all MEPs created within this MA will be created as VLAN MEPs. A given MEP may be configured with another VLAN than the MA's primary VID, but it is impossible to have untagged VLAN MEPs.
</dd>
<dt>CCM Interval</dt>
<dd>
The CCM rate of all MEPs bound to this Service.
</dd>
<dt>TLV option select</dt>
<dd>
<b>Sender Id</b>: Default Sender ID TLV format to be used in CCMs generated by this Service.
<br><samp>None</samp> Do not include Sender ID TLVs.
<br><samp>Chassis</samp> Enable Sender ID TLV and send Chassis ID (MAC Address).
<br><samp>Manage</samp> Enable Sender ID TLV and send Management address (IPv4 Address).
<br><samp>ChassisManage</samp> Enable Sender ID TLV and send both Chassis ID (MAC Address) and Management Address (IPv4 Address).
<br><samp>Defer</samp> Let the Domain configuration decide if Sender ID TLVs shall be included.
</dd>
<dd>
<br><b>Port Status</b>: Include or exclude Port Status TLV in CCMs generated by this Service or let higher level determine.
<br><samp>Disable</samp> Do not include Port Status TLVs.
<br><samp>Enable</samp> Include Port Status TLVs.
<br><samp>Defer</samp> Let the Domain configuration decide if Port Status TLVs shall be included.
</dd>
<dd>
<br><b>Interface Status</b>: Include or exclude Interface Status TLV in CCMs generated by this Service or let higher level determine.
<br><samp>Disable</samp> Do not include Interface Status TLVs.
<br><samp>Enable</samp> Include Interface Status TLVs.
<br><samp>Defer</samp> Let the Domain configuration decide if Interface Status TLVs shall be included.
</dd>
<dd>
<br><b>Org. Specific</b>: Exclude Organization-Specific TLV in CCMs generated by this Service or let higher level determine.
<br><samp>Disable</samp> Do not include Organization-Specific TLVs.
<br><samp>Defer</samp> Let the Domain configuration decide if Organization-Specific TLVs shall be included.
