<h1>PTP Clock Monitor Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect the current <a href="glossary.htm#ptp" class="glossary">PTP</a> clock
settings.</p>

<h2>PTP External Clock Description</h2>
<dl>

 <dt>One_PPS_Mode</dt>
 <dd>Shows the current One_pps_mode configured.</dd>
 <dd>1. Output  : Enable the 1 pps clock output</dd>
 <dd>2. Disable : Disable the 1 pps clock output</dd>

 <dt>External Enable</dt>
 <dd>Shows the current External clock output configuration.</dd>
 <dd>1. True    : Enable the external clock output</dd>
 <dd>2. False   : Disable the external clock output</dd>

 <dt>Adjust Method</dt>
 <dd>Shows the current Frequency adjustment configuration.</dd>
 <dd>1. LTC           : Use Local Time Counter (LTC) frequency control</dd>
 <dd>2. Single        : Use SyncE DPLL frequency control, if allowed by SyncE</dd>
 <dd>3. Independent   : Use an oscillator independent of SyncE for frequency control, if supported by the HW</dd>
 <dd>4. Common        : Use second DPLL for PTP, Both DPLL have the same (SyncE recovered) clock.</dd>
 <dd>4. Auto          : AUTO Select clock control, based on PTP profile and available HW resources.</dd>

 <dt>Clock Frequency</dt>
 <dd>Shows the current clock frequency used by the External Clock.</dd>
 <dd>The possible range of values are 1 - 25000000 (1 - 25MHz)</dd>

 <dt>One PPS Domain</dt>
 <dd>Shows the current clock domain used for generating 1pps clock output.</dd>
