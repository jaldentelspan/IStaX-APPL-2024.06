<h1>PTP Clock Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to configure and inspect the current <a href="glossary.htm#ptp" class="glossary">PTP</a> clock
settings.</p>

<h2>PTP External Clock Configuration</h2>
<dl>

 <dt>One_PPS_Mode</dt>
 <dd>This Selection box will allow you to select the One_pps_mode configuration.</dd>
 <dd>The following values are possible:</dd>
 <dd>1. Output  : Enable the 1 pps clock output</dd>
 <dd>2. Disable : Disable the 1 pps clock output</dd>

 <dt>External Enable</dt>
 <dd>This Selection box will allow you to configure the External Clock output.</dd>
 <dd>The following values are possible:</dd>
 <dd>1. True    : Enable the external clock output</dd>
 <dd>2. False   : Disable the external clock output</dd>

 <dt>Adjust Method</dt>
 <dd>This Selection box will allow you to configure the Frequency adjustment configuration.</dd>
 <dd>1. LTC           : Select Local Time Counter (LTC) frequency control</dd>
 <dd>2. Single        : Select SyncE DPLL frequency control, if allowed by SyncE</dd>
 <dd>3. Independent   : Select an oscillator independent of SyncE for frequency control, if supported by the HW</dd>
 <dd>4. Common        : Select second DPLL for PTP, Both DPLL have the same (SyncE recovered) clock.</dd>
 <dd>4. Auto          : AUTO Select clock control, based on PTP profile and available HW resources.</dd>

 <dt>Clock Frequency</dt>
 <dd>This will allow to set the Clock Frequency.</dd>
 <dd>The possible range of values are 1 - 25000000 (1 - 25MHz)</dd>

 <dt>One PPS Domain</dt>
 <dd>This box selects clock domain of chip from which 1pps signal need to be generated.</dd>
 <dd>On single clock domain boards, only clock domain zero is available.</dd>
 <dd>On boards with multiple clock domains such as VSC-47558, LAN-9668 and others, one of three clock domains can be chosen.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>PTP timestamping modes</h2>
<dl>

 <dt>PHY timestamping mode</dt>
 <dd>This selection box allows user to disable or enable phy timestamping on the board.</dd>
 <dd>On whichever ports PHY timestamping is enabled, those ports are affected by this selection.</dd>
 <dd>After disabling PHY timestamping, switch or Mac timestamping is used on those ports.</dd>
 <dd>This option must be saved to start-up config and board must be reboot for this selection to take effect.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>PTP Clock Configuration</h2>

<dl>

 <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd>Check this box and click on 'Save' to delete the clock instance.</dd>
 <dt>Clock Instance</dt>
 <dd>
  Indicates the instance number of a particular Clock Instance [0..3].
 </dd>
 <dd>
  Click on the Clock Instance number to edit the Clock details.
 </dd>
 <dt>Clk Domain</dt>
 <dd>
  Indicates the clock domain used by the clock.
 </dd>
 <dt>VID</dt>
 <dd>
  VLAN Identifier used for tagging the VLAN packets.
 </dd>
  <dt>Device Type</dt>
 <dd>
  Indicates the Type of the Clock Instance. There are seven Device Types.
 </dd>
 <dd>
  1. Ord-Bound  - clock's Device Type is Ordinary-Boundary Clock.
 </dd>
 <dd>
  2. P2p Transp - clock's Device Type is Peer to Peer Transparent Clock.
 </dd>
 <dd>
  3. E2e Transp - clock's Device Type is End to End Transparent Clock.
 </dd>
 <dd>
  4. Master Only - clock's Device Type is Master Only.
 </dd>
 <dd>
  5. Slave Only - clock's Device Type is Slave Only.
 </dd>
 <dd>
  6. AED GM - clock's Device Type is Grandmaster only (AED profile specific).
</dd>
 <dd>
  7. Internal - clock's Device Type is Internal i.e. this device is used to synchronize clock domains on same board.
</dd>
 <dt>Profile</dt> 
 <dd>Indicates the profile used by the clock.</dd>

<!--
 <dt><b> 2 Step Flag </b></dt>
 <dd> Static member: defined by the system, true if two-step Sync events and Pdelay_Resp events are used </dd>
 <dt><b> Clock Identity </b></dt>
 <dd> It shows unique clock identifier</dd>
 <dt><b> One Way </b></dt>
 <dd>If true, one-way measurements are used. This parameter applies only to a slave. In one-way mode no delay
 measurements are performed, i.e. this is applicable only if frequency synchronization is needed. The master always
 responds to delay requests.</dd>
 <dt><b> Protocol </b></dt>
 <dd>Transport protocol used by the PTP protocol engine </dd>
 <dd>Ethernet       PTP over Ethernet multicast </dd>
 <dd>EthernetMixed  PTP using a combination of Ethernet multicast and unicast</dd>
 <dd>IPv4Multi      PTP over IPv4 multicast </dd>
 <dd>IPv4Mixed      PTP using a combination of IPv4 multicast and unicast</dd>
 <dd>IPv4Uni        PTP over IPv4 unicast </dd>
 <dd>        Note : IPv4 unicast protocol only works in Master only and Slave only clocks </dd>
 <dd>               See parameter Device Type </dd>
 <dd>               In a unicast Slave only clock you also need configure which master clocks </dd>
 <dd>               to request Announce and Sync messages from. See: Unicast Slave Configuration </dd>
 <dt><b> VID </b></dt>
 <dd>VLAN Identifier used for tagging the PTP frames.</dd>
 <dd>   Note:   Packets are tagged if the port is configured for vlan tagging for the configured VID.</dd>
 <dt><b> PCP </b></dt>
 <dd>Priority Code Point value used for PTP frames.</dd>  -->
