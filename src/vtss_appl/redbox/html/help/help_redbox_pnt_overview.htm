<h1>RedBox ProxyNodeTable Overview Help</h1>

<p>This page gives an overview of the contents of the ProxyNodeTable of all
created <a href="glossary.htm#RedBox" class="glossary">RedBox</a> instances.</p>

If a RedBox instance is created, but not enabled, a single line will show
'Inactive'. Otherwise the following information will appear:

<dl>
  <dt>Action</dt>
  <dd>
    This field contains a button that - when clicked - will cause only that
    entry's ProxyNodeTable to be cleared. The clearing will happen immmediately.
    <br/>

    Notice that the RedBox itself inserts two MAC addresses that will never be
    cleared. One is for the RedBox itself and the other is for the device's
    management MAC address.
  </dd>

  <dt>Instance</dt>
  <dd>
    Identifies the RedBox instance number.<br/>

    If active, this also functions as a hyperlink to a detailed ProxyNodeTable
    page for that instance.
  </dd>

  <dt>Mode</dt>
  <dd>
    The mode this RedBox is currently operating in.
  </dd>

  <dt>MAC Addresses</dt>
  <dd>
    This indicates the number of MAC addresses currently stored in the
    ProxyNodeTable.
  </dd>

  <dt>Wrong LAN</dt>
  <dd>
    This is only relevant in HSR-PRP mode. In other modes it is shown with a
    dash ('-').<br/>

    If at least one of the entries in the ProxyNodeTable has a non-zero Wrong
    LAN counter, it indicates this with a 'Yes'. Otherwise it reads 'No'.
  </dd>
</dl>
