<h1>RedBox Statistics Overview Help</h1>

<p>This page shows a statistics summary of all created
<a href="glossary.htm#RedBox" class="glossary">RedBox</a> instances.</p>

Rx and Tx are seen from the RedBox' perspective. 'Port C Rx', for instance,
means the number of frames received by the RedBox from the switch core side.
<br/>

If a RedBox instance is created, but not enabled, a single line spanning all
status columns will show 'Inactive'. Otherwise, the columns will
be filled with the following information:

<dl>
  <dt>Action</dt>
  <dd>
    This field contains a button that - when clicked - will cause only that
    entry's statistics to be cleared. The clearing will happen immmediately.
  </dd>

  <dt>Instance</dt>
  <dd>
    Identifies the RedBox instance number.<br/>

    If active, this also functions as a hyperlink to a detailed statistics page
    for that instance.
  </dd>

  <dt>Mode</dt>
  <dd>
     The mode this RedBox is currently operating in.
  </dd>

  <dt>Port A/B/C Rx</dt>
  <dd>
    This indicates the number of frames received on the
    <a href="glossary.htm#LRE" class="glossary">LRE</a> port. The number
    includes both HSR-tagged, HSR-untagged, frames with RCT, frames without RCT,
    as well as number of BPDUs.
  </dd>

  <dt>Port A/B/C Tx</dt>
  <dd>
    This indicates the number of frames transmitted on the LRE port. The number
    includes both HSR-tagged, HSR-untagged, frames with RCT, frames without RCT,
    as well as number of BPDUs.
  </dd>
</dl>
