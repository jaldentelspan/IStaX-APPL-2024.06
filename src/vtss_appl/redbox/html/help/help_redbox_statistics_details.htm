<h1>Detailed RedBox Statistics Help</h1>

<p>This page shows detailed statistics for a given
<a href="glossary.htm#RedBox" class="glossary">RedBox</a> instance.</p>

Rx and Tx are seen from the RedBox' perspective. 'Port C Rx', for instance,
means the number of frames received by the RedBox from the switch core side.
<br/>

At the top right corner, the page offers a drop-down list, where any of the
creatable RedBox instances can be selected. If selecting an instance that is not
created, a single line spanning all columns will show 'Not created'. If
selecting an instance that is created, but not enabled, a single line spanning
all columns will show 'Inactive'.<br/>

If an instance is created and enabled, there are Rx and Tx counters per RedBox
port (Port A, Port B, and Port C). Not all counters types have both an Rx and Tx
part. If a Rx counter doesn't have a Tx counter-part, a dash ('-') is shown for
the Tx counter, and vice versa.<br/>

Many of these counters will only count in particular RedBox modes, but all of
them are always displayed.<br>

The following explains the rows of the table.

<dl>
  <dt>Tagged</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of frames that are
    <a href="glossary.htm#HSR-tag" class="glossary">HSR-tagged</a> and/or carry
    an <a href="glossary.htm#RCT" class="glossary">RCT</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>Untagged</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of frames that are not HSR-tagged or carry an RCT.
  </dd>

  <dt>BPDUs</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of BPDUs (frames with DMAC = <tt>01:80:C2:00:00:0x</tt>).
  </dd>

  <dt>Own</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of frames received whose SMAC matches a MAC address in the
    ProxyNodeTable.
  </dd>

  <dt>Wrong LAN</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of frames received with wrong LanId.
  </dd>

  <dt>Zero Duplicates</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of times a frame has been transmitted from the port without any
    duplicates seen before the &lt;SMAC, SeqNr&gt; tuple timed out after
    Duplicate Discard age time.
  </dd>

  <dt>One Duplicate</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of times a frame has been transmitted from the port where one
    duplicate has been discarded before the &lt;SMAC, SeqNr&gt; tuple timed out
    after Duplicate Discard age time.
  </dd>

  <dt>Two or More Duplicates</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of times a frame has been transmitted from the port where two or more
    duplicates have been discarded before the &lt;SMAC, SeqNr&gt; tuple timed
    out after Duplicate Discard age time.
  </dd>

  <dt>PRP-DD Supervision</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of supervision frames of type PRP-Duplicate-Discard.
  </dd>

  <dt>PRP-DA Supervision</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of supervision frames of type PRP-Duplicate-Accept.
  </dd>

  <dt>HSR Supervision</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of supervision frames of type HSR.
  </dd>

  <dt>Erroneous Supervision</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of erroneous supervision frames received. An erroneous supervision is
    detected when either of these holds true:
    <ul>
      <li>TLV1 not present or</li>
      <li>TLV1's length is invalid or</li>
      <li>TLV1.Type is not 20, 21, or 23 or</li>
      <li>TLV1.MAC is not a unicast MAC or</li>
      <li>TLV2 is present <b>and</b>
        <ul>
          <li>TLV2's length is invalid or</li>
          <li>TLV2.Type is not 30 or</li>
          <li>TLV2.MAC is not a unicast MAC or</li>
        </ul>
      <li>TLV0 is not present or</li>
      <li>Frame is not long enough</li>
     </ul>

     Erroneous supervision frames are not counted in the PRP-DD, PRP-DA, or HSR
     supervision frame counters.
  </dd>

  <dt>Filtered Supervision</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of good received supervision frames that were not used because of one
    or more of the following reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The supervision frame was received on an <a href="glossary.htm#LRE"
        class="glossary">LRE</a> Port <b>and</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Port C is blocked for some reason or</li>
          <li>
            Port C's VLAN ingress filtering is enabled, but Port C is not a
            member of the classified VLAN
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        If TLV2.MAC is present and is either the RedBox' own MAC address or the
        switch's management MAC address or TLV2 is not present and TLV1.MAC is
        either of the two MAC addresses
      </li>
      <li>
        The supervision frame was received on a port in PRP mode but did not
        contain a valid <a href="glossary.htm#RCT" class="glossary">RCT</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        The supervision frame was received on a port in HSR mode but did not
        contain a valid <a href="glossary.htm#HSR-tag" class="glossary">HSR
        tag</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        RedBox is in HSR-PRP mode and supervision frame received on LRE port and
        software
        <a href="help_redbox_config.htm#hsr-to-prp">HSR-to-PRP translation</a>
        is enabled, but no ports in the PRP network are members of the
        classified VLAN
      </li>
    </ul>
