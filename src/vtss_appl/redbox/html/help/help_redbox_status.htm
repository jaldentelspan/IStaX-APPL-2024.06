<h1>RedBox Status Help</h1>

<p>This page shows the status of all created <a href="glossary.htm#RedBox"
class="glossary">RedBox</a> instances.</p>

If a RedBox instance is created, but not enabled, a single line spanning all
status columns will show 'Inactive'. Otherwise, the columns will
be filled with the following information:

<dl>
  <dt>Instance</dt>
  <dd>
    Identifies the RedBox instance number.
  </dd>

  <dt>Mode</dt>
  <dd>
     Shows the mode in which the RedBox is currently running. See
     <a href="help_redbox_config.htm#mode">RedBox Configuration Help</a> for a
     list of possible modes.
  </dd>

  <dt>Port A</dt>
  <dd>
    This is the physical interface (port) configured as
    <a href="glossary.htm#LRE" class="glossary">LRE</a> port A.<br/>

    If the RedBox instance connects directly to a neighboring RedBox instance
    on the same physical device without using physical ports and loop cables,
    the port is called 'Neighbor'.
  </dd>

  <dt>Port B</dt>
  <dd>
    See description of Port A above.
  </dd>

  <dt>Port C</dt>
  <dd>
    This is the interlink port. This port number comes indirectly from the
    configuration of Port A and Port B, as follows:<br/>
    If Port A is 'Neighbor', Port C is the same as Port B. Otherwise Port C is
    the same as Port A.<br/><br/>

    If both Port A and Port B refer to real ports, Port A is - as said - the
    interlink port (Port C). Whatever you configure on this port corresponds to
    configuring both Port A and Port B. Port B is considered unconnected -
    except for configured port speeds and link.
  </dd>

  <dt>Configurational Warnings</dt>
  <dd>
    This shows whether there are configurational warnings that should be solved
    in order for this RedBox to work properly configuration-wise.<br/>

    Refer to
    <a href="help_redbox_config.htm#oper_state">RedBox Configuration Help</a>
    for a description of the colors and a list of possible configurational
    warnings.<br/>
  </dd>

  <dt>Notifications</dt>
  <dd>
    At runtime, various conditions that need to attract the operator's
    attention may arise.<br/>

    Notifications fall into two groups as indicated with a color:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <img src="../images/led-up.gif" alt="green"/>:
        No runtime errors observed.
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../images/led-down.gif" alt="down"/>:
        Runtime errors are observed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    If runtime errors are observed, hover the mouse over the image to see a list
    of the errors. The possible errors are as follows:

    <span id="notif_status">?</span><br/>

    A notification disappears when the erroneous condition is no longer
    detected.<br/>

    It may take up to <span id="StatisticsPollInterval">?</span> seconds for the
    'Wrong LAN ID' and 'without an HSR tag' conditions to be detected. Once such
    a condition goes away, it will take at least
    <span id="AlarmRaisedTime">?</span> seconds until the notification
    disappears.
  </dd>
