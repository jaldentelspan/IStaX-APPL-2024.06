<h1>RedBox Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect and modify the current <a
href="glossary.htm#RedBox" class="glossary">RedBox</a> configurations.</p>

There is one row per possible RedBox instance. A RedBox instance must be created
before it is configurable. The buttons in the Action column allow for this.

<dl>
  <dt>Action</dt>
  <dd>
    To create a given RedBox instance, press the Create button. Already created
    RedBox instances can be deleted with a click on the Delete button.<br/>
    Notice that the click itself doesn't change the underlying configuration.
    Only when the Save button is clicked, will the configuration take effect.
  </dd>

  <dt>Instance</dt>
  <dd>
    Identifies the RedBox instance number.
  </dd>

  <dt>Enable</dt>
  <dd>
    Enables or disables a given RedBox instance. If enabling, a click on the
    Save button causes software to perform additional checks before actually
    enabling the RedBox instance in hardware. If a check fails, the user will
    get notified.<br/>

    If disabling, the RedBox instance is removed entirely from hardware.
  </dd>

  <!-- Don't delete the anchor. It may be referred to from other pages -->
  <dt><a name="mode">Mode</a></dt>
  <dd>
     A RedBox may run in one of four different modes:
     <ul>
       <li>PRP-SAN</li>
       <li>HSR-SAN</li>
       <li>HSR-PRP</li>
       <li>HSR-HSR</li>
     </ul>

     In PRP-<a href="glossary.htm#RedBox-SAN" class="glossary">SAN</a> mode, the
     two <a href="glossary.htm#LRE" class="glossary">LRE</a> ports (Port A and
     Port B) are connected to the PRP network's LAN A and LAN B, respectively.
     Port C corresponds to the remaining ports in the switch core and makes up
     the 'gateway' to the SAN network. Port C is also known as the interlink
     port.<br/>

     In HSR-SAN mode, the two LRE ports (Port A and Port B) connect to the HSR
     ring and the switch core (Port C) connects to the SAN network.<br/>

     In HSR-PRP mode, the two LRE ports connect to the HSR ring managed by this
     RedBox instance and Port C connects to a PRP network - either LAN A or LAN
     B.<br/>

     In HSR-HSR mode, the two LRE ports connect to the HSR ring managed by this
     RedBox instance and Port C connects to another RedBox' Port C. You may
     think of the connection between the two RedBoxes as a wire. The other
     RedBox may or may not be located on the same device as this RedBox.
  </dd>

  <dt>Port A</dt>
  <dd>
    Select the physical interface that constitues LRE Port A. A given physical
    port can serve only one specific RedBox instance. The drop-down box lists
    only those interfaces that the corresponding RedBox supports.<br/>

    It is possible to 'serialize' two or more RedBoxes by utilizing a special
    port called 'Neighbor'. With this interface, an internal connection is made
    to connect one RedBox to another, freeing up two physical ports on the
    device for other purposes.<br/>

    RedBox instance 1's Port A does not have a Neighbor option, because there
    is no RedBox 'to the left' of RedBox #1. Likewise, RedBox instance
    <span id="InstCntMax">?</span>'s Port B does not have a Neighbor option,
    because there is no RedBox 'to the right' of the last RedBox instance.
  </dd>

  <dt>Port B</dt>
  <dd>
    Select the physical interface that constitues LRE Port B. See description of
    Port A for details.
  </dd>

  <dt>Net ID</dt>
  <dd>
    The Net ID (called 'NetId' in IEC-62439-3) is a number between 1 and 7 and
    is used in HSR-PRP and HSR-HSR modes, only.<br/>

    The Net ID is along with the LAN ID ('LanId' in IEC-62439-3) used to form
    the 4-bit Path ID ('PathId' in IEC-62439-3), which is used in frames
    transmitted to the RedBox' HSR ring.<br/>

    In the other direction, it is used to prevent frames originated by this
    RedBox to return to the interlink and the PRP network (in HSR-PRP mode) or
    accompanying HSR RedBox (in HSR-HSR mode), by a method known as Net ID
    filtering: Frames arriving on the LRE ports carrying the same Net ID as the
    RedBox is configured with will be filtered towards Port C.
  </dd>

  <dt>LAN ID</dt>
  <dd>
    The LAN ID (called 'LanId' in IEC-62439-3) is used in HSR-PRP mode, only. It
    tells the RedBox whether the PRP-side of the RedBox is connected to LAN A or
    LAN B. In this way, the RedBox can convert the <a
    href="glossary.htm#HSR-tag" class="glossary">HSR tag</a> in frames arriving
    on LRE ports to a correct <a href="glossary.htm#RCT"
    class="glossary">RCT</a> before it is sent to the PRP network.
  </dd>

  <dt>NodesTable Age Time</dt>
  <dd>
    The NodesTable keeps track of source MAC addresses (SMACs) of frames
    received on LRE ports.<br/>

    In PRP-SAN mode, the NodesTable is used to identify a node either as a SAN
    or a DAN (DANP). The first time a given SMAC is seen on an LRE port, it is
    marked as a SAN, so the frames coming from the interlink and destined to
    that MAC address will be sent to one LRE port, only. If the same SMAC is
    seen on both Port A and Port B - or a supervision frame is received for that
    MAC address, the entry will be marked as a DAN, so that frames destined to
    that MAC address and coming from the interlink will have an RCT added and
    will be sent to both Port A and Port B. Frames arriving on LRE ports with
    same &lt;SMAC, RCT.SeqNr&gt; tuple are subject to duplicate discarding.<br/>

    In HSR modes (HSR-SAN, HSR-PRP, and HSR-HSR), the NodesTable serves a
    slightly different purpose. The first time a given SMAC is seen on an LRE
    port, that MAC address is added to the NodesTable as a DAN (SANs do not
    exist on HSR rings in Mode H). Frames destined to that MAC address coming
    from the interlink are always sent to both Port A and Port B with an HSR
    tag, and frames arriving on both Port A and Port B are subject to duplicate
    discarding based on the &lt;SMAC, HSR.SeqNr&gt; tuple.<br/>

    The NodesTable Age Time determines the number of seconds a given entry
    resides in the NodesTable after it was last seen on Port A or Port B.<br/>

    Valid range is
    <span id="NtAgeTimeMin">?</span> - <span id="NtAgeTimeMax">?</span> seconds
    with a default of <span id="NtAgeTimeDefault">?</span> seconds.
  </dd>

  <dt>ProxyNodeTable Age Time</dt>
  <dd>
    The ProxyNodeTable keeps track of source MAC addresses (SMACs) of frames
    received on the interlink port (Port C).<br/>

    In PRP-SAN and HSR-SAN mode, all nodes in the ProxyNodeTable are considered
    SANs, and frames coming from the LRE ports and leaving the interlink port
    will have the RCT (PRP-SAN) or HSR tag (HSR-SAN) removed.<br/>

    In HSR-PRP mode, a node in the ProxyNodeTable can either be a SAN or a
    DAN (DANP). A supervision frame sent by a DANP in the PRP network will cause
    the entry type to change from a SAN to a DAN. Once it is identified as a
    DAN, subsequent frames arriving from the DANP must carry an RCT. If not,
    those frames will be discarded by the RedBox and only forwarded in the PRP
    network.<br/>

    The ProxyNodeTable Age Time determines the number of seconds a given entry
    resides in the ProxyNodeTable after it was last seen on the interlink port.
    <br/>

    Valid range is
    <span id="PntAgeTimeMin">?</span> - <span id="PntAgeTimeMax">?</span>
    seconds with a default of <span id="PntAgeTimeDefault">?</span> seconds.
  </dd>

  <dt>Duplicate Discard Age Time</dt>
  <dd>
    The Duplicate Discard Age Time determines how long the RedBox shall wait for
    a copy of &lt;SMAC, SeqNr&gt; before the RedBox considers all copies
    received and forgets the entry.<br/>

    Valid range is
    <span id="DdAgeTimeMin">?</span> - <span id="DdAgeTimeMax">?</span>
    milliseconds with a default of <span id="DdAgeTimeDefault">?</span>
    milliseconds.
  </dd>

  <dt>Supervision Frames VLAN ID</dt>
  <dd>
    The RedBox sends - towards the LRE ports - supervision frames on behalf of
    SANs connected to the switch core side of the RedBox in PRP-SAN, HSR-SAN,
    and HSR-PRP mode.<br/>

    This field chooses the VLAN ID with which these supervision frames are
    sent. If using the value 0, the RedBox sends with the interlink port's
    native VLAN ID (the Port VLAN ID).<br/>

    The RedBox software knows whether to actually tag the supervision frames
    based on the interlink port's tagging configuration. It also knows whether
    the interlink port is a member of the VLAN ID, and if not, it refrains from
    sending supervision frames.<br/>

    Notice: The RedBox hardware only supports recognizing HSR tags behind VLAN
    tags with a TPID of 0x8100 (C-tag), so if the interlink port is configured
    to VLAN tag with another TPID, the software sends with that TPID but
    receiving RedBoxes may not understand this as a VLAN tag, so it will not be
    able to find the HSR tag behind it, which may cause such frames to be
    discarded. This goes for all sorts of frames, not only supervision frames.
    <br/>

    Valid range is 0 - 4095 with a default of <span id="SvVlanDefault">?</span>.
  </dd>

  <dt>Supervision Frames PCP</dt>
  <dd>
    Whenever the RedBox software determines that a frames should be transmitted
    VLAN tagged, it also inserts a <a href="glossary.htm#PCP"
    class="glossary">PCP</a> value into the VLAN tag. This value comes from this
    configuration.<br/>

    Notice, that even the native VLAN may have to be transmitted tagged, so the
    PCP value may also matter when the VLAN ID is set to 0.<br/>

    Valid range is 0 - 7 with a default of <span id="SvPcpDefault">?</span>.
  </dd>

  <dt>Supervision Frames DMAC LSByte</dt>
  <dd>
    This field controls the value used in the least significant byte of the
    destination MAC address used in supervision frames sent by the RedBox, that
    is the 'xx' of <tt>01:15:4E:00:01:xx</tt>.<br/>

    A network operator can identify certain parts of the network through the use
    of different values of this field.<br/>

    Upon reception of supervision frames, the RedBox ignores the LSbyte.<br/>

    Valid range is 0x00 - 0xFF with a default of
    <span id="SvDmacLsbDefault">?</span>.
  </dd>

  <dt>Supervision Frames Interval</dt>
  <dd>
    The interval with which supervision frames are sent by this RedBox. To
    avoid bursting of supervision frames, the first frame sent on behalf of a
    SAN is transmitted after a random number of milliseconds between 0 and this
    value. Subsequent supervision frames for a given SAN are transmitted this
    value seconds apart.<br/>

    Valid range is
    <span id="SvFrameIntervalMin">?</span> - <span
    id="SvFrameIntervalMax">?</span> seconds with a default of
    <span id="SvFrameIntervalDefault">?</span> seconds.
  </dd>

  <dt>Supervision Frames PRP-to-HSR</dt>
  <dd>
    This field is only used in HSR-PRP mode.<br/>

    When checked, supervision frames from the PRP network are software forwarded
    as HSR supervision frames to the HSR ring.<br/>

    When unchecked, supervision frames from the PRP network are hardware
    forwarded without modifications to the HSR ring.<br/>

    Especially older HSR-capable equipment that only supports supervision frames
    of the HSR type require this option to be checked.<br/>

    Except for changing the supervision frame type from PRP-Duplicate-Discard
    or PRP-Duplicate-Accept to HSR when software forwarding, more checks are
    done on the supervision frame, such as checks for correct RCT, correct DMAC
    (except for least significant byte), correct TLV1.MAC, and correct TLV2.MAC.
    These checks cannot be performed when hardware forwarding the frames.<br/>

    Default is <span id="SvXlatPrpToHsrDefault">?</span id>.
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="hsr-to-prp">Supervision Frames HSR-to-PRP</a></dt>
  <dd>
    This field is only used in HSR-PRP mode.<br/>

    When checked, supervision frames from the HSR ring are software forwarded
    as PRP-Duplicate-Discard supervision frames to the PRP network.<br/>

    When unchecked, supervision frames from the HSR ring are hardware forwarded
    without modifications to the PRP network.<br/>

    Especially older PRP-capable equipment that only supports supervision frames
    of the PRP type require this option to be checked.<br/>

    Except for changing the supervision frame type from HSR to
    PRP-Duplicate-Discard when software forwarding, more checks are done on the
    supervision frame, such as checks for correct HSR tag, correct DMAC
    (except for least significant byte), correct TLV1.MAC, and correct TLV2.MAC.
    These checks cannot be performed when hardware forwarding the frames.<br/>

    Default is <span id="SvXlatHsrToPrpDefault">?</span id>.
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="oper_state">Operational State</a></dt>
  <dd>
    This shows the current operational state of a RedBox instance.<br/>

    A color indicates the state as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
         <img src="../images/led-off.gif" alt="gray"/>:
         The instance is not created or not enabled
       </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../images/led-up.gif" alt="green"/>:
        The instance is enabled with no configurational warnings
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../images/led-yellow.gif" alt="yellow"/>:
        The instance is enabled, but there are configurational warnings
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../images/led-down.gif" alt="down"/>:
        The instance is enabled, but an internal error has occurred. See console
        or crashlog for details
      </li>
    </ul>

    When yellow, hover the mouse over the image to see a list of
    configurational warnings. The possible warnings are as follows:
    <span id="oper_warnings">?</span><br/>

    It is highly recommended to have a green color on enabled instances.<br/>

    It is important to notice that not all configuration errors can be detected
    by the RedBox software.
