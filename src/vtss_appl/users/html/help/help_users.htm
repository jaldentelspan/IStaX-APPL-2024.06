<h1>Users Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page provides an overview of the current users. Currently the
only way to login as another user on the web server is to close and
reopen the browser.</p>
<p>The displayed values for each user are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>User Name</dt>
 <dd>
 The name identifying the user. This is also a link to
 <a href="help_user_config.htm">Add/Edit User</a>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Privilege Level</dt>
 <dd>
 The privilege level of the user. The allowed range is <samp>0</samp> to <samp>15</samp>.
 If the privilege level value is 15, it can access all groups, i.e. that is granted the fully control of the device.
 But others value need to refer to each group privilege level. User's privilege should be same or greater than the group privilege level to have the access of that group.
 By default setting, most groups privilege level 5 has the read-only access and privilege level 10 has the read-write access.
 And the system maintenance (software upload, factory defaults and etc.) need user privilege level 15.
 Generally, the privilege level 15 can be used for an administrator account,
 privilege level 10 for a standard user account and privilege level 5 for a guest account.
