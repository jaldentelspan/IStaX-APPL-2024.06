<h1>Shared VLAN Learning Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows for controlling <a href="glossary.htm#svl" class="glossary">SVL</a> configuration on the switch<span class="SPOM_only"> stack</span>.</br>
In SVL, one or more VLANs map to a Filter ID (FID). By default, there is a one-to-one mapping from VLAN to FID, in which case the switch acts as an <a href="glossary.htm#ivl">IVL</a> bridge, but
with SVL multiple VLANs may share the same MAC address table entries.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Delete</dt>
  <dd>
    A previously allocated FID can be deleted by the use of this button.
  </dd>

  <dt>FID</dt>
  <dd>
    The Filter ID (FID) is the ID that VLANs get learned on in the MAC table when SVL is in effect.<br/>
    No two rows in the table can have the same FID and the FID must be a number between 1 and <span class="fid_max">?</span>.
  </dd>

  <dt>VLANs</dt>
  <dd>
    List of VLANs mapped into FID.<br/>
    The syntax is as follows: Individual VLANs are separated by commas.
    Ranges are specified with a dash separating the lower and upper bound.<br/>
    The following example will map VLANs 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 200, and 300: <samp>1,10-13,200,300</samp>. Spaces are allowed in between the delimiters.
    The range of valid VLANs is <span class="vid_min">?</span> to <span class="vid_max">?</span>.<br/>
    The same VLAN can only be a member of one FID. A message will be displayed if one VLAN is grouped into two or more FIDs.<br/>
    All VLANs must map to a particular FID, and by default VLAN x maps to FID x. This implies that if FID x is defined, then
    VLAN x is implicitly a member of FID x unless it is specified for another FID. If FID x doesn't exist, a confirmation message
    will be displayed, asking whether to continue adding VLAN x implicitly to FID x.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p><input type="button" value="Add FID">: Add a new row to the SVL table. The FID will be pre-filled with the first unused FID.</p>

<p><input type="button" value=" Reset ">: Click to undo any changes made locally and revert to previously saved values.</p>
