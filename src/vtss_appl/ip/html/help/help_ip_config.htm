   <dt>IPv4 DHCP Client Identifier IfMac</dt>
   <dd>
     The interface name of DHCP client identifier. When DHCPv4 client is enabled
     and the client identifier type is 'ifmac', the configured interface's
     hardware MAC address will be used in the DHCP option 61 field.
   </dd>

     MAC addresses as the hostname.

   <dt>IPv4 DHCP Fallback Timeout</dt>
   <dd>
     The number of seconds for trying to obtain a DHCP lease. After
     this period expires, a configured IPv4 address will be used as
     IPv4 interface address. A value of zero disables the fallback
     mechanism, such that DHCP will keep retrying until a valid lease
     is obtained. When fallback is disabled, no static IP address
     shall be specified. Legal values are 0 to 4294967295 seconds.

     For DHCP interfaces with an active lease, this column show the
     current interface address, as provided by the DHCP server.

   <dt>IPv4 Address</dt>
   <dd>
     The IPv4 address of the interface
     in <a href="glossary.htm#dotted_decimal" class="glossary">dotted
     decimal notation</a>. <br> If <samp>DHCP</samp> is enabled, this
     field configures the fallback address. The field may be left
     blank if IPv4 operation on the interface is not desired - or no
     DHCP fallback address is desired.
   </dd>

   <dt>IPv4 Mask</dt>
   <dd>
     The IPv4 network mask, in number of bits (<i>prefix
     length</i>). Valid values are between 0 and 30 bits for a IPv4
     address. <br> If <samp>DHCP</samp> is enabled, this field
     configures the fallback address network mask. The field may be
     left blank if IPv4 operation on the interface is not desired - or
     no DHCP fallback address is desired.

     digits with a colon separating each field (:).  For example,
     <samp>fe80::215:c5ff:fe03:4dc7</samp>.  The
     symbol <samp>::</samp> is a special syntax that can be used as a
     shorthand way of representing multiple 16-bit groups of
     contiguous zeros; but it can appear only once.

   <dt class="ipv6 hidden">Resolving IPv6 DAD</dt>
   <dd class="ipv6 hidden">
     The link-local address is formed from an interface identifier
     based on the hardware address which is supposed to be uniquely
     assigned. Once the DAD (Duplicate Address Detection) detects
     the address duplication, the operation on the interface SHOULD
     be disabled.
     <br>At this moment, manual intervention is required to resolve
     the address duplication. For example, check whether the loop
     occurs in the VLAN or there is indeed other device occupying
     the same hardware address as the device in the VLAN.
     <br>After making sure the specific link-local address is unique
     on the IPv6 link in use, delete and then add the specific IPv6
     interface to restart the IPv6 operations on this interface.
