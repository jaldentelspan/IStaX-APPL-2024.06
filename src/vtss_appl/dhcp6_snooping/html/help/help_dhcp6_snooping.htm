<h1>DHCPv6 Snooping Configuration Help</h1>

<h2><a href="glossary.htm#dhcp_snooping" class="glossary">DHCPv6 Snooping</a> Configuration</h2>

<p>Configure DHCPv6 (aka. DHCP over IPv6) Snooping on this page.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Snooping Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the DHCPv6 snooping mode operation.
 <br>Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable DHCPv6 snooping mode operation. When DHCPv6 snooping mode operation is enabled, the DHCPv6 client
 request messages will be forwarded to trusted ports and only allow reply packets from trusted ports.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable DHCP snooping mode operation.
 </dd>

 <dt>Unknown IPv6 Next-Headers</dt>
<dd>
 Indicates how Unknown IPv6 Next-Header values should be treated. The switch needs to parse all IPv6 packets to a DHCPv6 client to determine
 if it is in fact a DHCPv6 message. If an unknown IPv6 extension header is encountered the parsing cannot continue.
 See RFC 7610, section 5, item 3 for details.

 <br>Possible options are:
 <br><samp>Drop</samp>: Drop packets with unknown IPv6 extension headers. This is the most secure option but may result in traffic disruptions.
 <br><samp>Allow</samp>: Allow packets with unknown IPv6 extension headers. This is a less secure option but prevents traffic disruptions.
 </dd>

 <dt>Port Mode Configuration</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the DHCPv6 snooping port mode.
 <br>Possible port modes are:
 <br><samp>Trusted</samp>: Configures the port as trusted source of the DHCPv6 messages.
 <br><samp>Untrusted</samp>: Configures the port as untrusted source of the DHCPv6 messages.
 </dd>
