<h1>DHCPv6 Snooping Table Help</h1>
<p>This page displays the content of the current DHCPv6 snooping table.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>DUID</dt>
    <dd>
        The DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) for the client. DHCPv6 uses this value
        to uniquely identify a client host instead of just using the MAC address of
        one of its interface ports (as DHCPv4 does).
    </dd>
    <dt>MAC Address</dt>
    <dd>
        The MAC address for the client interface port that sent the DHCPv6 message.
    </dd>
    <dt>VLAN ID</dt>
    <dd>
        The VLAN ID which is used by the client messages.
    </dd>
    <dt>Local Ingress Port</dt>
    <dd>
        The local port on the snooping switch where client messages are received.
    </dd>
    <dt>DHCP Server Address</dt>
    <dd>
        The IPv6 address of the DHCP server which assigned the address to the client.
    </dd>
    <dt>IAID</dt>
    <dd>
        Each client may contain multiple interfaces and may request addresses for
        each of these in the same DHCPv6 message. The Identity Association ID (IAID)
        value uniquely identifies the interface in the scope of the client.
    </dd>
    <dt>Assigned Address</dt>
    <dd>
        The address assigned to the interface identified by the IAID value.
    </dd>
    <dt>Lease Time</dt>
    <dd>
        The lease time associated with the assigned address in seconds.
    </dd>
</dl>
