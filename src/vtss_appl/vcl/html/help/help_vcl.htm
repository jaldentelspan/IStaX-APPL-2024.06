<h1>VCL MAC-Based VLAN Configuration Help</h1>

<p>
  The MAC address to VLAN ID mappings can be configured here. This page allows adding and deleting MAC-based VLAN Classification List
  entries and assigning the entries to different ports.
</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd >
  To delete a MAC to VLAN ID mapping entry, check this box and press save. The entry will be deleted <span class="SPOM_only">from the selected switch </span> in the stack.
 </dd>

 <dt>MAC Address</dt>
 <dd>
  Indicates the MAC address of the mapping.
 </dd>

 <dt>VLAN ID</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the VLAN ID the above MAC will be mapped to.
 </dd>

 <dt>Port Members</dt>
 <dd>
  A row of check boxes for each port is displayed for each MAC to VLAN ID mapping entry. To include a port in
  the mapping, check the box. To remove or exclude the port from the mapping, make sure the 
  box is unchecked. By default, no ports are members, and all boxes are unchecked.
 </dd>

 <dt>Adding a New MAC to VLAN ID mapping entry</dt>
 <dd>
   Click <input type="button" value=" Add New Entry "> to add a new MAC to VLAN ID mapping entry. An empty row 
   is added to the table, and the mapping can be configured as needed. Any unicast MAC address 
   can be used to configure the mapping. No broadcast or multicast MAC addresses are allowed.
   Legal values for a VLAN ID are <samp>1</samp> through <samp>4095</samp>.<br/><br/>
   The MAC to VLAN ID entry is enabled <span class="SPOM_only">in the selected stack switch unit</span> 
   when you click on "Save".
   A mapping without any port members <span class="SPOM_only">in any stack unit </span>will not be 
   added when you click "Save".<br/><br/> The <input type="button" value=" Delete "> button can be 
   used to undo the addition of new mappings.
   The maximum possible MAC to VLAN ID mapping entries are limited to 256.
