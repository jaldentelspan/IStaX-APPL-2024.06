 <dd>
 The Privilege Levels can be configured between <samp>0</samp> to <samp>15</samp> (where 0 is lowest level and 15 is highest level)
 Every group has an authorization Privilege level for the following sub groups: configuration read-only, configuration/execute read-write, status/statistics read-only, status/statistics read-write (e.g. for clearing of statistics).  User Privilege should be same or greater than the authorization Privilege level to have the access to that group.
