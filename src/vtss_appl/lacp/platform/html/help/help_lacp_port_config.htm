<h1>LACP Port Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect the
current <a href="glossary.htm#lacp" class="glossary">LACP</a> port
configurations, and possibly change them as well.</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">The LACP port settings relate to the currently
selected stack unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   The switch port number.
 </dd>

 <dt>LACP</dt>
 <dd>
   Show whether LACP is currently enabled on this switch port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Timeout</dt>
 <dd>
   The <samp>Timeout</samp> controls the period between BPDU transmissions.  <samp>Fast</samp> will transmit LACP packets each second,
   while <samp>Slow</samp> will wait for 30 seconds before sending a LACP packet.
 </dd>
 <dt>Prio</dt>
 <dd>
   The <samp>Prio</samp> controls the priority of the port, range 1-65535.  If the LACP partner wants to form a larger group than is supported by this device 
   then this parameter  will control which ports will be active and which ports will be in a backup role. Lower number means greater priority.
 </dd>
