<h1>LACP Internal Port Status Help</h1>

<p>This page provides a status overview for the <a href="glossary.htm#lacp" class="glossary">LACP</a> internal (i.e. local system) status for all ports.</p>
<p>Only ports that are part of an LACP group are shown.</p>
<p>For details on the shown parameters please refer to IEEE 801.AX-2014.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
 The switch port number.
 </dd>

 <dt>State</dt>
 <dd>
 The current port state:
 <ul>
     <li><b>Down:</b> The port is not active.</li>
     <li><b>Active:</b> The port is in active state.</li>
     <li><b>Standby:</b> The port is in standby state.</li>
 </ul>
 </dd>

 <dt>Key</dt>
 <dd>
 The key assigned to this port. Only ports with the same key can aggregate together.
 </dd>

 <dt>Priority</dt>
 <dd>
 The priority assigned to this aggregation group.<span class="SPOM_only"> IDs 1 and 2 are GLAGs while IDs 3-14 are LLAGs.</span>
 </dd>

 <dt>Activity</dt>
 <dd>
 The LACP mode of the group (Active or Passive).
 </dd>

 <dt>Timeout</dt>
 <dd>
 The timeout mode configured for the port (Fast or Slow).
 </dd>

 <dt>Aggregation</dt>
 <dd>
 Show whether the system considers this link to be "aggregateable"; i.e., a potential candidate for aggregation.
 </dd>

 <dt>Synchronization</dt>
 <dd>
 Show whether the system considers this link to be "IN_SYNC"; i.e., it has been allocated to the correct LAG, the group has been associated
 with a compatible Aggregator, and the identity of the LAG is consistent with the System ID and operational Key information transmitted.
 </dd>

<dt>Collecting</dt>
 <dd>
 Show if collection of incoming frames on this link is enabled.
 </dd>

<dt>Distributing</dt>
 <dd>
 Show if distribution of outgoing frames on this link is enabled.
 </dd>

 <dt>Defaulted</dt>
 <dd>
 Show if the Actor's Receive machine is using Defaulted operational Partner information.
 </dd>

 <dt>Expired</dt>
 <dd>
 Show if that the Actor's Receive machine is in the EXPIRED state.
 </dd>
