<h1>MVR Channels (Groups) Information Table</h1>

<p>
  Entries in the <a href="glossary.htm#mvr" class="glossary">MVR</a> Channels (Groups) Information Table are shown on this page.
  The MVR Channels (Groups) Information Table is sorted first by <a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a>, and then by group.<br/>
</p>

<h2> Navigating the MVR Channels (Groups) Information Table</h2>
<p>
  Each page shows up to 99 entries from the MVR Group table, default being 20, selected through the
  "entries per page" input field. When first visited, the web page will show the first 20 entries from
  the beginning of the MVR Channels (Groups) Information Table.<br/>
  The "Start from <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a>", and "Group Address" input fields allow the user to select the 
  starting point in the MVR Channels (Groups) Information Table.
  Clicking the <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button will update the displayed table starting from
  that or the closest next MVR Channels (Groups) Information Table match. In addition, the two input fields will - 
  upon a <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button click - assume the value of the first displayed entry,
  allowing for continuous refresh with the same start address.<br/>
  The <input type="button" value=" >> "/> will use the last entry of the currently displayed table as a basis for 
  the next lookup. When the end is reached the text "No more entries" is shown in the
  displayed table. Use the <input type="button" value=" |<<"/> button to start over.
</p>
