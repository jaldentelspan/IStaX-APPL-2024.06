<h1>MVR SFM Information Table</h1>

<p>
  Entries in the <a href="glossary.htm#mvr" class="glossary">MVR</a> SFM Information Table are shown on this page.
  The MVR SFM (Source-Filtered Multicast) Information Table also contains the SSM (Source-Specific Multicast) information.
  This table is sorted first by <a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a>, then by group, and then by Port. 
  Different source addresses belong to the same group are treated as single entry.<br/>
</p>

<h2> Navigating the MVR SFM Information Table</h2>
<p>
  Each page shows up to 99 entries from the MVR SFM Information Table, default being 20,
  selected through the "entries per page" input field. When first visited, the web page will show the first 20 entries
  from the beginning of the MVR SFM Information Table.<br/>
  The "Start from <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a>", and "Group Address" input fields allow the user to select the
  starting point in the MVR SFM Information Table.
  Clicking the <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button will update the displayed table starting from
  that or the closest next MVR SFM Information Table match. In addition, the two input fields will - 
  upon a <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button click - assume the value of the first displayed entry,
  allowing for continuous refresh with the same start address.<br/>
  The <input type="button" value=" >> "/> will use the last entry of the currently displayed table as a basis for 
  the next lookup. When the end is reached the text "No more entries" is shown in the
  displayed table. Use the <input type="button" value=" |<<"/> button to start over.
</p>
