    <h1>Port Security Static and Sticky MAC Address Configuration Help</h1>
      On this page, you may add and delete static and sticky MAC addresses
      managed by Port Security.<br/><br/>
      Port security defines three types of MAC addresses, of which static and
      sticky can be added and removed on this page:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Dynamic</b>: A MAC address learned through learn frames coming to the
          Port Security module while the interface in qeustion is not in sticky
          mode. Dynamic entries disappear if it ages out or if the interface
          link goes down.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Static</b>: A MAC address added by end-user through management. Static
          MAC addresses are not subject to aging and will be added to the MAC
          address table once Port Security gets enabled on the interface.<br/>
          Static entries are part of the running-config and will survive
          interface link state changes and reboots if saved to startup-config.
          Static entries can be added to the running-config at any time whether
          or not Port Security is enabled.
        </li>
        <li>
           <b>Sticky</b>: When the interface is in sticky mode, all entries that would
           otherwise have been learned as dynamic are learned as sticky.</br>
           Like static entries, sticky entries are part of the running-config
           and will survive interface link state changes and reboots if saved to
           the startup-config.<br/>
           Though not the intention with Sticky entries, they can be added by
           management to the running-config at any time whether or not Port
           Security is enabled on the interface, as long as the interface is in
           Sticky mode. Sticky entries will disappear if the interface is taken
           out of Sticky mode.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Table Description</h2>
    The table contains one row per static or sticky MAC address.
    <dl>
      <dt>Delete</dt>
      <dd>
        Press this button to remove the entry from the MAC address table (if
        present) and the running-config.<br/>
        Notice that dynamic entries may be removed all-together on an interface
        through
        &quot;Monitor&rarr;Security&rarr;Port Security&rarr;Switch&quot;
        and one-by-one through
        &quot;Monitor&rarr;Security&rarr;Port Security&rarr;Port&quot;
      </dd>

      <dt>Port</dt>
      <dd>
        The port number to which this MAC address is bound.
      </dd>

      <dt>VLAN ID &amp; MAC Address </dt>
      <dd>
        The VLAN ID and MAC address in question.
      </dd>

      <dt>Type</dt>
      <dd>
        Indicates the type of entry and may be either Static or Sticky (see
        description above).
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Buttons</h2>
    <p>
      <input type="button" value=" Add New MAC Entry ">: Clicking this button
      will add a new row to the table. This new row allows for adding a static
      or sticky MAC address to a particular interface. Once satisfied, click the
      Save-button to save the changes to running-config.<br/>
      Notice that sticky entries are normally added automatically through
      learning on the interface.
    <p>
      <input type="button" value=" Refresh">: Click to refresh the page. Note
      that non-committed changes will be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="button" value=" Save ">: Click to save changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="button" value=" Reset ">: Click to undo any changes made
      locally and revert to previously saved values.
