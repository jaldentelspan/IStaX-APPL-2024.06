<h1>Automatic Protection Switching (APS) Configuration Help</h1>

The APS module implements the protocol and linear protection switching mechanisms for point-to-point VLAN-based ETH SNC in Ethernet transport
networks. Automatic Protection Switching is defined by the ITU G.8031 standard.

<p> This page allows the user to create and configure an <a href="glossary.htm#APS" class="glossary">APS</a> Instance.</p>

<h2>Configuration Data</h2>
<dl>

 <dt>APS #</dt>
 <dd>The ID of the APS. Maximum number of creatable APS instances is <span id="InstanceMax"></span> . Click on link to get to APS instance page, you can reset counters and issue commands.</dd>

 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
    The Port this flow is attached to.
 </dd>

 <dt>SF Trigger</dt>
 <dd>
    Selects whether Signal Fail (SF) comes from the link state of a given Port, or from a Down-MEP.
 </dd>

 <dt>SF MEP</dt>
 <dd>
 The Domain::Service::MEPID refers to a MEP instance which shall represent the Working flow. Only used when SF Trigger is MEP.
 The selected MEP instance does not need to exist when this APS is configured.
 </dd>

 <dt>Mode</dt>
 <dd>
    <p><b>1:1</b> This will create a 1:1 APS.</p>
    In the linear 1:1 protection switching architecture, the protection transport
    entity is dedicated to the working transport entity. However, the normal traffic
    is transported either on the working transport entity or on the protection
    transport entity using a selector bridge at the source of the protected domain.
    The selector at the sink of the protected domain selects the entity which
    carries the normal traffic.

    <p><b>1+1 Uni</b> This will create a 1+1 Unidirectional APS.</p> 
    <p><b>1+1 Bi</b> This will create a 1+1 Bidirectional APS.</p>

    In the linear 1+1 protection switching architecture, a protection transport
    entity is dedicated to each working transport entity. The normal traffic is
    copied and fed to both working and protection transport entities with a
    permanent bridge at the source of the protected domain. The traffic on working
    and protection transport entities is transmitted simultaneously to the sink of
    the protected domain, where a selection between the working and protection
    transport entities is made based on some predetermined criteria, such as server
    defect indication.
 </dd>


 <dt>Level</dt>
 <dd>
  MD/MEG Level (0-7).
 </dd>

 <dt>VLAN</dt>
 <dd>
  The VLAN ID used in the L-APS PDUs. 0 means untagged.
 </dd>

 <dt>PCP</dt>
 <dd>
  PCP (priority) (default 7). The PCP value used in the VLAN tag unless the L-APS PDU is untagged. Must be a value in range 0 - 7.
 </dd>

<dt>SMAC</dt>
<dd>
  Source MAC address used in L-APS PDUs. Must be a unicast address. If all-zeros, the switch port's MAC address will be used.
</dd>

 <dt>Rev</dt>
 <dd>
<br>When checked, the port recovery mode is revertive, that is, traffic switches
back to the working port after the condition(s) causing a switch has
cleared. In the case of clearing a command (e.g. forced switch), this
happens immediately. In the case of clearing of a defect, this generally
happens after the expiry of the WTR (Wait-To-Restore) timer.

<br>When unchecked, the port recovery mode is non-revertive and traffic is
allowed to remain on the protect port after a switch reason has cleared.
 </dd>

 <dt>TxAps</dt>
 <dd>Choose whether this end transmits APS PDUs. Only used for 1+1, unidirectional.</dd>

 <dt>WTR</dt>
 <dd>
When Rev is checked, WTR (Wait-To-Restore) tells how many seconds to wait
before restoring to the working port after a fault condition has cleared.
Valid range 1 - <span id="WtrSecsMax"></span>
</dd>

 <dt>HoldOff</dt>
 <dd>
When a new (or more severe) defect occurs, the hold-off timer will be started and the event will be reported
after the timer expires. HoldOff time is measured in milliseconds, and valid values are in
the range 0 - <span id="HoldOffMsecsMax"></span>. Default is 0, which means immediate reporting of the defect.
</dd>

 <dt>Enable</dt>
 <dd>The administrative state of this APS instance. Check to make it function normally and uncheck to make it cease functioning.</dd>

 <dt>Oper</dt>
 <dd>This field can not be configured, but shows the operational state. You can click on the link in the APS # field to get more details on the status.</dd>
 <dd><img src="../images/led-up.gif" alt="up" width="10" height="10"> APS instance is functional.</dd>
 <dd><img src="../images/led-down.gif" alt="down" width="10" height="10"> APS instance is not functional.</dd>

<dt>Warning</dt>
<dd>If the operational state is Active, the APS instance is indeed active, but it may be that it doesn't run as the administrator thinks, 
because of configuration errors, which are reflected in the warnings below.</dd>
<dd>The Warning information is indicated by <img src="../images/led-off.gif" alt="down" width="10" height="10">: no warning, <img src="../images/led-yellow.gif" alt="down" width="10" height="10">: warning.</dd>
<dd>Use the tooltip to get the detailed warning information.</dd>
</dl>
