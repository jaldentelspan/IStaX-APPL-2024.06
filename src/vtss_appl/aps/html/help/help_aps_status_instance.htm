<h1>APS Status Help</h1>

<h2>APS Configuration</h2>
<dl>
<dd>This table shows the current configuration for this APS instance. Go to the APS Configuration help page for further explanation.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>APS Status</h2>
<dl>
<dd>This shows the current status of the APS instance. If the Operational state is not "Active", the remaining fields are invalid.</dd>
<dt>State, Operational</dt>

<dd>The operational state of the APS instance. There are many ways to not have the instance active. Each of them has its own value.
Only when the state is Active, will the APS instance be active and up and running. The possible values of this field are shown below:</dd>
<dd><b>Administratively disabled:</b> Instance is inactive, because it is administratively disabled.</dd>
<dd><b>Active:</b> The instance is active and up and running.</dd>
<dd><b>Internal Error:</b> Instance is inactive, because an internal error has occurred.</dd>
<dd><b>Working MEP not Found:</b>Instance is inactive, because the Working MEP is not found.</dd>
<dd><b>Protecting MEP not Found:</b> Instance is inactive, because the Protecting MEP is not found.</dd>
<dd><b>Working MEP is not administrative active:</b> Instance is inactive, because the Working MEP is not admin enabled.</dd>
<dd><b>Protecting MEP is not administrative active:</b> Instance is inactive, because the Protecting MEP is not admin enabled.</dd>
<dd><b>Working MEP is not a Down MEP:</b> Instance is inactive, because the Working MEP is not a Down-MEP.</dd>
<dd><b>Protecting MEP is not a Down MEP:</b> Instance is inactive, because the Protecting MEP is not a Down-MEP.</dd>
<dd><b>Working and Protecting MEP use the same interface:</b> Instance is inactive, because both Working and Protecting MEPs use the same I/F.</dd>
<dd><b>Another instance use the same Working port:</b> Instance is inactive, because another instance uses the same Working port.</dd>

<dt>State, Warning</dt>

<dd>If the operational state is Active, the APS instance is indeed active, but it may be that it doesn't run as the administrator thinks, 
because of configuration errors, which are reflected in the warnings below.</dd>
<dd>The Warning information is indicated by <img src="../images/led-off.gif" alt="down" width="10" height="10">: no warning, <img src="../images/led-yellow.gif" alt="down" width="10" height="10">: warning.</dd>
