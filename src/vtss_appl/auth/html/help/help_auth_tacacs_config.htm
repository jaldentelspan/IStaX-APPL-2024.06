    <h1>TACACS+ Server Configuration Help</h1>
    <p>
      This page allows you to configure up to <span class="AuthServerCnt">?</span> <a href="glossary.htm#tacplus" class="glossary">TACACS+</a> servers.
    
    </p>

    <h2>Global Configuration</h2>
    These setting are common for all of the TACACS+ servers.
    <dl>
      <dt>Timeout</dt>
      <dd>
        Timeout is the number of seconds, in the range <span class="AuthTimeoutMin">?</span> to <span class="AuthTimeoutMax">?</span>,
        to wait for a reply from a TACACS+ server before it is considered to be dead.
      </dd>
      <dt>Deadtime</dt>
      <dd>
        Deadtime, which can be set to a number between <span class="AuthDeadtimeMin">?</span> to <span class="AuthDeadtimeMax">?</span> minutes,
        is the period during which the switch will not send new requests to a server that has failed to respond to a previous request.
        This will stop the switch from continually trying to contact a server that it has already determined as dead.<br/>
        Setting the Deadtime to a value greater than 0 (zero) will enable this feature, but only if more than one server has been configured.
      </dd>
      <dt>Change Secret Key</dt>
      <dd>
        Specify to change the secret key or not. When "Yes" is selected for the option,
        you can change the secret key - up to <span class="AuthKeyLen">?</span> characters long - shared between the TACACS+ server and the switch.<br/>
        When the "No" option is selected and no global key is currently
        configured, the "Key" input field is blank. If a key is configured, the
        "Key" input field contains asterisks.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Server Configuration</h2>
    The table has one row for each TACACS+ server and a number of columns, which are:
    <dl>
      <dt>Delete</dt>
      <dd>
        To delete a TACACS+ server entry, check this box. The entry will be deleted during the next Save.
      </dd>
      <dt>Hostname</dt>
      <dd>
        The IPv4/IPv6 address<span class="has_dns"> or hostname</span> of the TACACS+ server.
      </dd>
      <dt>Port</dt>
      <dd>
        The <a href="glossary.htm#tcp" class="glossary">TCP</a> port to use on the TACACS+ server for authentication.
      </dd>
      <dt>Timeout</dt>
      <dd>
        This optional setting overrides the global timeout value. Leaving it blank will use the global timeout value.
      </dd>
      <dt>Change Secret Key</dt>
      <dd>
        Specify to change the secret key or not. When the checkbox is checked,
        you can change the setting overrides the global key. Leaving it blank will use the global key.
        When the checkbox is unchecked, the field contains asterisks if a key is
        configured, otherwise it is blank.
      </dd>
    </dl>

      to the table, and the TACACS+ server can be configured as needed. Up to <span class="AuthServerCnt">?</span> servers are supported.<br/>
      The <input type="button" value=" Delete "> button can be used to undo the addition of the new server.
    </p>
