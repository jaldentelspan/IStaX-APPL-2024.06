    <h1>RADIUS Server Configuration Help</h1>
    <p>
      This page allows you to configure up to <span class="AuthServerCnt">?</span> <a href="glossary.htm#radius" class="glossary">RADIUS</a> servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Global Configuration</h2>
    These setting are common for all of the RADIUS servers.
    <dl>
      <dt>Timeout</dt>
      <dd>
        Timeout is the number of seconds, in the range <span class="AuthTimeoutMin">?</span> to <span class="AuthTimeoutMax">?</span>,
        to wait for a reply from a RADIUS server before retransmitting the request.
      </dd>
      <dt>Retransmit</dt>
      <dd>
        Retransmit is the number of times, in the range <span class="AuthRetransmitMin">?</span> to <span class="AuthRetransmitMax">?</span>,
        a RADIUS request is retransmitted to a server that is not responding. If the server has not responded after the last retransmit it is considered to be dead.
      </dd>
      <dt>Deadtime</dt>
      <dd>
        Deadtime, which can be set to a number between <span class="AuthDeadtimeMin">?</span> to <span class="AuthDeadtimeMax">?</span> minutes,
        is the period during which the switch will not send new requests to a server that has failed to respond to a previous request.
        This will stop the switch from continually trying to contact a server that it has already determined as dead.<br/>
        Setting the Deadtime to a value greater than 0 (zero) will enable this feature, but only if more than one server has been configured.
      </dd>
      <dt>Change Secret Key</dt>
      <dd>
        Specify to change the secret key or not. When "Yes" is selected for the option,
        you can change the secret key - up to <span class="AuthKeyLen">?</span> characters long - shared between the RADIUS server and the switch.
      </dd>
      <dt>NAS-IP-Address (Attribute 4)</dt>
      <dd>
        The IPv4 address to be used as attribute 4 in RADIUS Access-Request packets.
        If this field is left blank, the IP address of the outgoing interface is used.
      </dd>
      <dt class="has_ipv6">NAS-IPv6-Address (Attribute 95)</dt>
      <dd class="has_ipv6">
        The IPv6 address to be used as attribute 95 in RADIUS Access-Request packets.
        If this field is left blank, the IP address of the outgoing interface is used.
      </dd>
      <dt>NAS-Identifier (Attribute 32)</dt>
      <dd>
        The identifier - up to 253 characters long - to be used as attribute 32 in RADIUS Access-Request packets.
        If this field is left blank, the NAS-Identifier is not included in the packet.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Server Configuration</h2>
    The table has one row for each RADIUS server and a number of columns, which are:
    <dl>
      <dt>Delete</dt>
      <dd>
        To delete a RADIUS server entry, check this box. The entry will be deleted during the next Save.
      </dd>
      <dt>Hostname</dt>
      <dd>
        The IPv4/IPv6 address<span class="has_dns"> or hostname</span> of the RADIUS server.
      </dd>
      <dt>Auth Port</dt>
      <dd>
        The <a href="glossary.htm#udp" class="glossary">UDP</a> port to use on the RADIUS server for authentication. Set to 0 to disable authentication.
      </dd>
      <dt>Acct Port</dt>
      <dd>
        The <a href="glossary.htm#udp" class="glossary">UDP</a> port to use on the RADIUS server for accounting. Set to 0 to disable accounting.
      </dd>
      <dt>Timeout</dt>
      <dd>
        This optional setting overrides the global timeout value. Leaving it blank will use the global timeout value.
      </dd>
      <dt>Retransmit</dt>
      <dd>
        This optional setting overrides the global retransmit value. Leaving it blank will use the global retransmit value.
      </dd>
      <dt>Change Secret Key</dt>
      <dd>
        Specify to change the secret key or not. When the checkbox is checked,
        you can change the setting overrides the global key. Leaving it blank will use the global key.
      </dd>
    </dl>
