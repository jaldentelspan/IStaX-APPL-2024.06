<h1> TSN Configuration Help</h1>

<p>When using TAS and PSFP between network elements, it is required to have a common global time reference provided by PTP. 
  When booting the device, it will take some time for a configured PTP application to get locked to the common time reference. 
  It may cause malfunctioning of TAS and PSFP if config-change is issued before PTP time is in a Locked or Locking state. 
  A function which can delay the issue of config-change until PTP is Locked/Locking or a configurable time has passed, 
  can be configured here.</p>
