<h1> TAS Status Parameters Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect the current  <a href="glossary.htm#TAS" class="glossary">TAS</a>
configurations, and possibly change them as well.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   Port number of the switch.
 </dd>

 <dt>Oper Gate Enabled</dt>
 <dd>
   The Enabled parameter shows whether traffic scheduling is active (true) or inactive (false).
 </dd>

 <dt>Oper Gate States</dt>
 <dd>
   The current state of the gate associated with each queue for the Port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Cycle Time Value</dt>
 <dd>
   The operational value of the gating cycle for the Port. The Cycle Time variable is a rational number of seconds, defined by value and a unit.
 </dd>

 <dt>Cycle Time Unit</dt>
 <dd>
   The operational Cycle Time unit. May be milliseconds, microseconds or nanoseconds.
 </dd>

 <dt>Cycle Time Extension</dt>
 <dd>
   An integer number of nanoseconds, defining the maximum amount of time by which the gating cycle for the
   Port is permitted to be extended when a new cycle configuration is installed.
 </dd>

 <dt>Base Time</dt>
 <dd>
   The operational value of base time, expressed as an IEEE 1588 precision time protocol (PTP) timescale.
 </dd>

 <dt>Current Time</dt>
 <dd>
   The current time, in PTPtime, as maintained by the local system. The value is a representation of a PTPtime value, consisting of a 48-bit integer number of seconds and a 32-bit integer number of nanoseconds.
   Only the seconds are displayed.
 </dd>

 <dt>Config Change Time</dt>
 <dd>
   The PTPtime at which the next config change is scheduled to occur. The value is a representation of a PTPtime value,
   consisting of a 48-bit integer number of seconds and a 32-bit integer number of nanoseconds.
 </dd>

 <dt>Config Change Error</dt>
 <dd>
   A counter of the number of times that a re-configuration of the traffic schedule has been requested with the old schedule still 
   running and the requested base time was in the past.
 </dd>

 <dt>Tick Granularity</dt>
 <dd>
   The granularity of the cycle time clock, represented as an unsigned number of tenths of nanoseconds.
 </dd>

 <dt>Config Pending</dt>
 <dd>
   The value of the ConfigPending state machine variable. The value is TRUE if a configuration change is in progress but has not yet completed.
 </dd>

 <dt>GCL Length</dt>
 <dd>
   The operational value of the gate control list length parameter for the Port. The integer value indicates the number of entries (TLVs) in the operational gate control list.
 </dd>

 <dt>GCL</dt>
 <dd>
   A link to the GCL parameter status.
 </dd>
</dl>
