<h1>TSN Egress Port Frame Preemption Status Help</h1>

<p>This page provides an overview of TSN Egress Port Frame Preemption Status all switch ports.</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">The ports belong to the currently selected stack
unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>

<p>The displayed settings are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
 The logical port for the settings contained in the same row.
 </dd>

 <dt>Hold Advance</dt>
 <dd>
  The value of the holdAdvance parameter for the Port in nanoseconds.
  There is no default value; the holdAdvance is a property of the underlying MAC.
 </dd>

 <dt>Release Advance</dt>
 <dd>
  The value of the releaseAdvance parameter for the Port in nanoseconds.
  There is no default value; the releaseAdvance is a property of the underlying MAC.
 </dd>

 <dt>Preemption Active</dt>
 <dd>
  The value is active (TRUE) when preemption is operationally
  active for the Port, and idle (FALSE) otherwise.
</dd>

 <dt>Hold Request</dt>
 <dd>
  The value is hold (TRUE) when the sequence of gate operations
  for the Port has executed a Set-And-Hold-MAC operation,
  and release (FALSE) when the sequence of gate operations has
  executed a Set-And-Release-MAC operation.
  The value of this object is release (FALSE) on system initialization.
 </dd>

 <dt>Status Verify</dt>
 <dd>
   The status of the MAC Merge sublayer verification for the given device. The possible values are:
   <table summary="Explanation of value">
     <tr>
       <td>initial</td>
       <td>Verification process is initializing</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>idle</td>
       <td>The verification process is ongoing</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>send</td>
       <td>The verification process is ongoing</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>wait</td>
       <td>The verification process is ongoing</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>succeeded</td>
       <td>The verification process is completed and frame preemption is supported</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>failed</td>
       <td>The verification process is completed and frame preemption is not supported</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>disabled</td>
       <td>Frame preemption is disabled</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>indeterminate</td>
       <td>The verification process is completed but it cannot be determined whether link partner supports frame preemption</td>
     </tr>
   </table>
 </dd>

 <dt>LocPreemptsupport</dt>
 <dd>
  The value is TRUE when preemption is supported on the port, and FALSE otherwise.
 </dd>

 <dt>LocPreemptEnabled</dt>
 <dd>
  The value is TRUE when preemption is enabled on the port, and FALSE otherwise.
 </dd>

 <dt>LocPreemptActive</dt>
 <dd>
  The value is TRUE when preemption is operationally active on the port, and FALSE otherwise.
 </dd>

 <dt>LocAddFragSize</dt>
 <dd>
  The value of the 802.3br LocAddFragSize parameter for the port. The minimum size of non-final fragments supported by the receiver
  on the local port. This value is expressed in units of 64 octets of additional fragment length. The minimum non-final fragment
  size is: (LocAddFragSize + 1) * 64 octets.
 </dd>
