<h1> TAS SDU Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect the current  <a href="glossary.htm#TAS" class="glossary">TAS</a>
configurations, and possibly change them as well.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   Port number of the switch.
 </dd>

 <dt>Maximum SDU</dt>
 <dd>
   The value of the Maximum SDU size parameter for the traffic class supported by the port. This value is represented as an unsigned integer in the range 0-<span id="TasMaxSdu">?</span>.
   A value of 0 is interpreted as the Maximum SDU size supported by the underlying MAC: <span id="TasMaxSdu2">?</span>. The default value of the Maximum SDU parameter is 1536.<br>
   <br>
   The Maximum SDU size parameter is used to calculate the guard band time = Maximum SDU * 8 / LINK_SPEED (sec)<br>
   If frame preemption is enabled and a gate operaton is SetAndHold, the guard band time in preemptable queues is automatically selected as the frame preemption minimum fragment size plus 64 bytes.<br>
   <br>
   A queue is said to be preemptible, if frame preemption is enabled, and if this queue is not opened in a SetAndHold gate operation.
