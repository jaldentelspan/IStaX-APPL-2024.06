<h1>Frame Preemption Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page provides an overview of TSN Egress Port Frame Preemption Configuration.</p>

<p>The displayed settings are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
 The logical port for the settings contained in the same row. Please note that Frame Preemption is not supported on ports with maximum speed 25 Gigabit/sec and is also not supported on 10G Gigabit/sec Aquantia Copper port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Frame Preemption TX</dt>
 <dd>
  The value of the 802.3br aMACMergeEnableTx parameter for the port. This value determines whether
  frame preemption is enabled (TRUE) or disabled (FALSE) in the MAC Merge sublayer in the transmit direction.
 </dd>

 <dt>Start without LLDP</dt>
 <dd>
  When this field is checked, Frame Preemption will be active when Frame Preemption TX is checked.
 </dd>

 <dt>Verify Disable TX</dt>
 <dd>
  The value of the 802.3br aMACMergeVerifyDisableTx parameter for the port. This value determines whether
  the verify function is disabled (TRUE) or enabled (FALSE) in the MAC Merge sublayer in the transmit direction.
 </dd>

 <dt>Preemptable Queues</dt>
 <dd>
  This parameter is the administrative value of the preemption status for the priority. If checked, it takes value preemptable if
  frames queued for the priority are to be transmitted using the preemptable service for the Port. If not checked, it takes value express if
