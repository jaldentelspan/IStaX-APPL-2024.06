<dt>Configuration of Gate Control List</dt>
<dd>
A Gate Control List (GCL) is a list of Gate Control Entries (GCE).
The number of GCEs in a GCL is defined by GCL Length parameter.<br>
<br>
When defining a GCL, start with setting GCL Length. Then configure each GCE.
The sum of all Time Interval in a GCL must be equal to or less than the Cycle Time.
Each queue must be open in at least one GCE.<br>
<br>

The value of a Time Interval should always be larger than the guard band time (as specified thru the values of Maximum SDU size and LINK_SPEED)<br>
<br>

The required guard band time can be reduced if preemption is used. If the queue being closed consist
of Preemptible frames, and the queue being opened consists of Express frames, then a SetAndHold operation
can be included as part of the gate operation. This causes any currently transmitting Preemptible frame to
be preempted, reducing the latency before the port is ready to transmit Express frames.<br>
<br>
When a gate operation closes an input in a scheduler element, that input is permanently blocked until
another gate operation opens it again. Similarly, a SetAndHold on a port remains in effect until another gate
operation does a SetAndRelease.<br>
<br>
This needs to be kept in mind when stopping a GCL. If the last gate operation in the GCL leaves any
scheduler element input closed, or leaves a SetAndHold in effect, they can be left indefinitely, possibly
causing frames to be blocked in the switch.<br>
<br>
If one of the gate operations in a GCL opens everything, then the GCL should be arranged so that this
is the last operation in the GCL. A GCL always completes its cycle before stopping, thus this leaves
everything open after the GCL is stopped.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, after stopping a GCL that leaves inputs closed or SetAndHold in effect, it is necessary to
configure a dummy GCL with an "open all" gate operation and run it for one cycle.

<dt>Configuration of Gate Control Entry</dt>
<dd>
A Gate Control Entry (GCE) consists of 3 elements: State, Time interval and Operation.
</dd>

</dl>

<dl>

 <dt>GCE ID</dt>
 <dd>
   Index of Gate Control Element.
 </dd>

 <dt>Gate State</dt>
 <dd>
  The GateState configures for each queue whether it is open or closed in the given time interval.
</dd>

 <dt>Time Interval</dt>
 <dd>
  The time in nanoseconds where the gate have the open/close state as defined by the Gate State parameter.
  The value of a Time Interval should always be larger than the guard band time (as specified thru the values of max-sdu and LINK_SPEED).
  An open queue will always be opened for a small amount of time, even if the guard band time is larger than the configured Time Interval. 
  Valid range is 1-999999999
