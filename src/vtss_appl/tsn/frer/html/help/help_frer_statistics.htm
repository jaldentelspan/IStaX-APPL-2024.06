<h1>FRER Statistics Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect and clear the current
<a href="glossary.htm#FRER" class="glossary">FRER</a> statistics counters.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Clear</dt>
  <dd>
    Press this button to clear the counters for the particular instance.<br/>

    In recovery mode, not all rows may have a clear button. That's because a
    single instance may have several sets of statistics and therefore span
    several rows.
  </dd>

  <dt>Instance</dt>
  <dd>
    The FRER instance ID.<br/>

    In recovery mode, not all rows may have filled out the Instance. That's
    because a single instance may have several sets of statistics and therefore
    span several rows. For an empty instance, the instance number is the
    closest previous row in the table with a non-empty instance number.
  </dd>

  <dt>Mode</dt>
  <dd>
    Mode of operation. Generation or Recovery.<br/>

    In recovery mode, not all rows may have filled out the Mode. That's
    because a single instance may have several sets of statistics and therefore
    span several rows. For an empty mode, the  mode is the closest previous row
    in the table with a non-empty mode.
  </dd>

  <dt>Egress Port</dt>
  <dd>
    Only valid in recovery mode.<br/>

    In recovery mode, there is a set of statistics per egress port. This shows
    the egress port - both interface name and port port number - for which this
    row of statistics pertains. If empty, it is the same as the egress port
    presented in the closest previous non-empty row.
  </dd>

  <dt>Ingress Stream</dt>
  <dd>
    Only valid in recovery mode.<br/>

    In individual recovery mode, there is a set of statistics per Stream ID as
    well as a compound set of statistics.<br/>

    In non-individual recovery mode, there is only a compound set of statistics.
  </dd>

  <dt>Out of Order</dt>
  <dd>
    IEEE 802.1CB-2017: frerCpsSeqRcvyOutOfOrderPackets.<br/>

    Only valid in Recovery mode.
  </dd>

  <dt>Rogue</dt>
  <dd>
    IEEE 802.1CB-2017: frerCpsSeqRcvyRoguePackets.<br/>

    Only valid in Recovery mode.
 </dd>

  <dt>Passed</dt>
  <dd>
    IEEE 802.1CB-2017: frerCpsSeqRcvyPassedPackets.<br/>

    Only valid in Recovery mode.
  </dd>

  <dt>Discarded</dt>
  <dd>
    IEEE 802.1CB-2017: frerCpsSeqRcvyDiscardedPackets.<br/>

    Only valid in Recovery mode.
  </dd>

  <dt>Lost</dt>
  <dd>
    IEEE 802.1CB-2017: frerCpsSeqRcvyLostPackets.<br/>

    Only valid in Recovery mode.
  </dd>

  <dt>Tagless</dt>
  <dd>
    IEEE 802.1CB-2017: frerCpsSeqRcvyTaglessPackets.<br/>

    Only valid in Recovery mode.
  </dd>

  <dt>Latent Error Resets</dt>
  <dd>
    Only valid in recovery mode and only counts if Latent Error Detection is
    enabled.<br/>

    Counts the number of times the latent error reset function is invoked.
    Corresponds to IEEE 802.1CB-2017's frerCpsSeqRcvyLatentErrorResets.<br/>

    Only the first row of a sequence of rows that pertain to this FRER instace
    is filled in with its value, because it is identical for all statistics sets
    for a given FRER instance.
  </dd>

  <dt>Generation Matches</dt>
  <dd>
    Number of matches on ingress stream.<br/>

    Only valid in Generation mode.
  </dd>

  <dt>Resets</dt>
  <dd>
    In generation mode, this corresponds to IEEE 802.1CB-2017's
    frerCpsSeqGenResets<br/>

    In recovery mode, this corresponds to IEEE 802.1CB-2017's
    frerCpsSeqRcvyResets.
  </dd>
</dl>
