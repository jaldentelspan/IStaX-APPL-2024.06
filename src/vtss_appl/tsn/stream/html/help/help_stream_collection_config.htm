<h1>Stream Collection Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows for editing existing or add new streams collections.<br/>

A stream collection gathers one or more streams, which makes multiple streams
available in functions such as FRER in generator mode, where different streams
need to use the same sequence number generator.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Delete</dt>
  <dd>
    Click this button to delete a stream collection. The action happens
    immediately and without the user being prompted.<br/>

    If the stream collection was added with a click on the Add button, it is
    simply removed again.
  </dd>

  <dt>Stream Collection ID</dt>
  <dd>
    An ID uniquely identifying the stream collection. Valid values are in the
    range 1 to <span id="InstanceMax">?</span>.<br/>

    This can only be changed if adding a new stream collection.
  </dd>

  <dt>Stream ID List</dt>
  <dd>
    List of stream IDs that make up this stream collection. individual stream
    IDs are separated by a comma, and ranges are separated by a hyphen.<br>

    An example is <samp>1,3,5,7-9</samp>, where Stream IDs 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9
    are put into the stream collection.<br/>

    At most <span id="StreamsPerCollectionMax">?</span> streams can be stored in
    the same collection.
  </dd>

  <dt>Attached Clients</dt>
  <dd>
    Stream collections don't do anything by themselves. They are utilized by
    PSFP and FRER for matching particular flows. This field indicates which of
    those two protocols - if any - are utilizing a particular stream collection.
    The number in parenthesis shows the PSFP or FRER instance the stream
    collection is used on.<br/>
  </dd>

  <dt>Warnings</dt>
  <dd>
    Configuration of a stream collection may result in configurational warnings.
    <br/>

    For instance, if a stream collection doesn't carry any streams, it is not of
    any use, and a warning will appear.<br/>

    A color indicates the warning state as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
         <img src="../images/led-off.gif" alt="gray"/>:
         The stream collection is not yet created
       </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../images/led-up.gif" alt="green"/>:
        The stream collection has no configurational warnings
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../images/led-yellow.gif" alt="yellow"/>:
        The stream collection has configurational warnings
      </li>
    </ul>

    When yellow, hover the mouse over the image to see a list of
    configurational warnings. The possible warnings are as follows:
    <span id="configurational_warnings">?</span><br/>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p><input type="button" value="Add">: Click to add a new stream collection.</p>
<p><input type="button" value="Save">: Click to save changes.</p>
<p><input type="button" value="Reset">: Click to undo any changes made locally and revert to previously saved values.</p>
<p><input type="button" value="Refresh">: Click to refresh the page immediately. Any changes made locally will be lost. This is useful if the stream configuration has been changed from e.g. CLI.</p>
