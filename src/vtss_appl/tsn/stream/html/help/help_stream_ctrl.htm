<h1>Stream Configuration Overview Help</h1>
<p>
  This page gives an overview of the configured streams, and it allows for
  deleting and editing existing streams as well as adding new.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Stream ID</dt>
  <dd>
    The ID of the stream. The lower the ID, the higher precedence when matching.
    For example, if Stream #1 matches all frames with a multicast DMAC and
    Stream #2 matches a particular multicast DMAC, Stream #2 will never be hit.
  </dd>

  <dt>DMAC</dt>
  <dd>
    Indicates which types of destination MAC addresses are matched.
  </dd>

  <dt>SMAC</dt>
  <dd>
    Indicates whether a particular source MAC address (with an optional mask)
    or any source MAC address is matched.
  </dd>

  <dt>Outer VLAN Tag</dt>
  <dd>
     Indicates the required presence of an outer VLAN tag.
  </dd>

  <dt>Inner VLAN Tag</dt>
  <dd>
     Indicates the required presence of an inner VLAN tag.
  </dd>

  <dt>Protocol</dt>
  <dd>
    Indicates layer 3 and 4 matching options.
  </dd>

  <dt>Attached Clients</dt>
  <dd>
    Streams don't do anything by themselves. They are utilized by PSFP and FRER
    for matching particular flows. This field indicates which of those two
    protocols - if any - are utilizing a particular stream. The number in
    parenthesis shows the PSFP or FRER instance the stream is used on.<br/>

    A stream may be part of a stream collection, in which case no clients can be
    attached directly to the stream itself. They must attach to the stream
    collection. In this case, this fields shows a dash ("-"). See also next help
    topic.<br/>

    If no clients are attached to a stream, the stream will be installed into
    hardware anyway. This allows the user to create two streams, where the first
    e.g. matches a particular range of MAC address and the second matches the
    same range of MAC addresses plus some more. The second stream can them be
    used in FRER or PSFP to match all the MAC addresses of the second stream,
    except that from the first.
  </dd>

  <dt>Stream Collection</dt>
  <dd>
    If a stream is part of a stream collection, this shows the ID of the stream
    collection. The ID is a hyperlink to the stream collection configuration
    page. If the stream is not part of a stream collection, the field just shows
    "None".
  </dd>

  <dt>Warnings</dt>
  <dd>
    Configuration of a stream may result in configurational warnings.<br/>

    If it is yellow, at least one configurational warning is detected. Hover
    the mouse over the image to see a list of the warnings.<br/>

    If it is green, no configurational warnings are detected.<br/>

    For a description of the possible configurational warnings, refer to
    <a href="help_stream_edit.htm#warnings">Stream Configuration Help</a>.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Configuration Buttons</h2>
<dl>
  <dd>
    On the right hand side of each stream, you find two buttons:<br/>
    <img src="../images/edit.gif" alt="Edit">: Click to edit this stream.<br/>
    <img src="../images/del.gif"  alt="Delete">: Click to delete this stream
    (happens immediately without confirmation).<br/><br/>

    The very last row in the table also contains a button:<br/>
    <img src="../images/add.gif" alt="Add">: Click to create a new stream.
 </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p><input type="button" value="Refresh">: Click to refresh the page immediately. This is useful if the stream configuration has been changed from e.g. CLI.</p>
