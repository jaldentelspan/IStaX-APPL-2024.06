<h1>Stream Configuration Help</h1>

This page allows for editing existing or new streams.<br/>

At the top right corner, the page offers a drop-down list, where any of the
existing streams can be selected. Notice that if you have changed contents of a
stream without saving and then change to another stream, the changes will be
lost without confirmation.<br/>

Besides all the existing streams, the selector has one last item, which allows
for creating a new stream.<br/><br/>

The page is divided into sections corresponding to fields in a frame, starting
with Layer 2 fields (MAC addresses, possible VLAN tags, and EtherType) and
followed by Layer 3 and Layer 4 fields.

<h2>Stream ID</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="stream_id">Stream ID</a></dt>
  <dd>
    The ID of the stream. The lower the ID, the higher precedence when matching.
    For example, if Stream #1 matches all frames with a multicast DMAC and
    Stream #2 matches a particular multicast DMAC, Stream #2 will never be hit.
    <br/>

    If editing an existing stream, this field is not editable, but it is if
    adding a new.<br/>

    If attempting to save a new stream with an ID already in use, a confirmation
    box will be shown.
  </dd>

  <dt>Attached Clients</dt>
  <dd>
    Streams don't do anything by themselves. They are utilized by PSFP and FRER
    for matching particular flows. This field indicates which of those two
    protocols - if any - are utilizing a particular stream. The number in
    parenthesis shows the PSFP or FRER instance the stream is used on.<br/>

    A stream may be part of a stream collection, in which case no clients can be
    attached directly to the stream itself. They must attach to the stream
    collection. In this case, this fields shows a dash ("-"). See also next help
    topic.<br/>

    If no clients are attached to a stream, the stream will be installed into
    hardware anyway. This allows the user to create two streams, where the first
    e.g. matches a particular range of MAC address and the second matches the
    same range of MAC addresses plus some more. The second stream can them be
    used in FRER or PSFP to match all the MAC addresses of the second stream,
    except that from the first.
  </dd>

  <dt>Stream Collection</dt>
  <dd>
    If a stream is part of a stream collection, this shows the ID of the stream
    collection. The ID is a hyperlink to the stream collection configuration
    page. If the stream is not part of a stream collection, the field just shows
    "None".
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="warnings">Warnings</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Configuration of a stream may result in configurational warnings.<br/>

    For instance, if a stream is not instantiated on any ports, it is not of
    any use, and a warning will appear.<br/>

    A color indicates the warning state as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
         <img src="../images/led-off.gif" alt="gray"/>:
         The stream is not yet created
       </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../images/led-up.gif" alt="green"/>:
        The stream has no configurational warnings
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../images/led-yellow.gif" alt="yellow"/>:
        The stream has configurational warnings
      </li>
    </ul>

    When yellow, hover the mouse over the image to see a list of
    configurational warnings. The possible warnings are as follows:
    <span id="configurational_warnings">?</span><br/>

    It is important to note that not all configurational errors are detected. An
    example of configurational errors that are not detected includes the case
    described under <a href="#stream_id">Stream ID</a>, where stream #2 cannot
    be hit.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>MAC Addresses</h2>
Besides the heading row, this table holds one row for Destination MAC (DMAC)
address matching and another for Source MAC (SMAC) address matching.

<dl>
  <dt>DMAC/SMAC</dt>
  <dd>
    Indicates whether this row in the table is for DMAC or SMAC matching.
  </dd>

  <dt>Type</dt>
  <dd>
    The drop-down list for the DMAC offers the following options:
    <ul>
      <li>Any: Match on any DMAC (default)</li>
      <li>Multicast: Match on multicast (but not broadcast) frames</li>
      <li>Broadcast: Match on broadcast frames</li>
      <li>Unicast: Match on unicast frames</li>
      <li>Not Broadcast: Match on unicast and multicast frames</li>
      <li>Not Unicast: Match on multicast and broadcast frames</li>
      <li>MAC/Mask: Match on a particular DMAC address with mask. The 'MAC' and
          'Mask' fields will become available for editing when this is selected
      </li>
    </ul>

    The drop-down list for the SMAC offers only the following options:
    <ul>
      <li>Any: Match on any SMAC (default)</li>
      <li>MAC/Mask: Match on a particular SMAC address with mask. The 'MAC' and
          'Mask' fields will become available for editing when this is selected
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>MAC</dt>
  <dd>
    This field is only available when Type is set to 'MAC/Mask'.<br/>

    MAC address used in the matching along with the mask. See 'Mask' below for
    a description.
  </dd>

  <dt>Mask</dt>
  <dd>
    This field is only available when Type is set to 'MAC/Mask'.<br/>

    Mask to be used in the matching along with the MAC address. This cannot be
    all-zeros.<br/>

    Suppose you want to match on a particular OUI (the three most significant
    bytes of a MAC address), and suppose the OUI is <samp>00:01:C1</samp>. In
    that case, you will set 'MAC' to <samp>00:01:C1:00:00:00</samp> and 'Mask'
    to <samp>FF:FF:FF:00:00:00</samp>.
    <br/>

    When the configuration gets saved, bits in the 'MAC' address where
    the corresponding 'Mask' bits are zero will be cleared automatically.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>VLAN Tags</h2>
Besides the heading row, this table holds one row for outer VLAN tag matching
and another for inner VLAN tag matching.

<dl>
  <dt>Outer/Inner</dt>
  <dd>
    Indicates whether this row in the table is for outer or inner VLAN tag
    matching.
  </dd>

  <dt>Presence</dt>
  <dd>
    This drop-down list controls whether the VLAN tag must be present
    ('Required'), must not be present ('Not Allowed'), or it doesn't matter
    whether the frame is VLAN tagged or not ('Optional').<br/>

    If the Outer VLAN Tag's presence is set to 'Not Allowed', it is not possible
    to set the Inner VLAN Tag's presence to 'Required', because that doesn't
    make sense.<br/>

    Only when 'Presence' is set to 'Required' will the remaining fields of the
    row become available.
  </dd>

  <dt>Tag Type</dt>
  <dd>
    This field is only available when Presence is set to 'Required'.<br/><br/>

    If set to 'C-tag', only frames with EtherType (TPID) 0x8100 are matched.
    <br/>
    If set to 'S-tag', only frames with EtherTYpe (TPID) 0x88a8 are matched.
    <br/>
    If set to 'Any', both frames with EtherType (TPID) 0x8100 and 0x88a8 are
    matched.
  </dd>

  <dt>VLAN</dt>
  <dd>
    This field is only available when Presence is set to 'Required'.<br/>

    VLAN ID used in the matching along with the VLAN mask. See 'VLAN Mask' below
    for a description. Valid values are in the range [0-4095].
  </dd>

  <dt>VLAN Mask</dt>
  <dd>
    This field is only available when Presence is set to 'Required'.<br/>

    Mask to be used in the matching along with the VLAN ID. This is shown in
    hexadecimal notation but both hexadecimal and decimal values can be used
    when editing it.</br>

    A mask of all-zeros means that any VLAN ID is matched. A mask of all-ones
    means that only the specified VLAN ID is matched. Any mask value in the
    range [0x000-0xFFF] is accepted.<br/>

    When the configuration gets saved, bits in the 'VLAN' where the
    corresponding 'VLAN Mask' bits are zero will be cleared automatically.
  </dd>

  <dt>PCP</dt>
  <dd>
    This field is only available when Presence is set to 'Required'.<br/>

    PCP value used in the matching along with the PCP mask. See 'PCP Mask' below
    for a description.
  </dd>

  <dt>PCP Mask</dt>
  <dd>
    This field is only available when Presence is set to 'Required'.<br/>

    Mask to be used in the matching along with the PCP value.</br>

    A mask of all-zeros means that any PCP value is matched. A mask of all-ones
    (0x7) means that only the specified PCP value is matched.<br/>

    When the configuration gets saved, bits in 'PCP' where the corresponding
    'PCP Mask' bits are zero will be cleared automatically.
  </dd>

  <dt>DEI</dt>
  <dd>
    This field is only available when Presence is set to 'Required'.<br/>

    If set to '0', only frames with DEI = 0 are matched.<br/>
    If set to '1', only frames with DEI = 1 are matched.<br/>
    If set to 'Any', the frame's DEI value is not used in the matching.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Protocol</h2>
This section allows for configuring properties in frames beyond VLAN tags.
<br/>

Use the Type drop-down list to select what properties to configure. The following
are supported:
<ul>
   <li>Any: Don't use properties beyond VLAN tags for matching</li>
   <li>EtherType: Match on the frame's EtherType</li>
   <li>LLC: Match on LLC frames</li>
   <li>SNAP: Match on SNAP frames</li>
   <li>IPv4: Match on IPv4 frames</li>
   <li>IPv6: Match on IPv6 frames</li>
</ul>

Each of these types (except Any) have associated configurable parametrs. These
are outlined below per type.

<h2>EtherType</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>EtherType</dt>
  <dd>
    A hexadecimal (or decimal) value ranging from 0x600 to 0xffff indicating the
    frame's EtherType, e.g. 0x800 for IPv4 (notice that IP has better matching
    properties than just the EtherType, so this was just an example).
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>LLC</h2>
LLC (Logical Link Control) frames are frames with an EtherType/TypeLength field
&lt; 0x600.<br/>

The LLC header carries two mandatory fields: DSAP and SSAP, whose values are
used in the matching.

<dl>
  <dt>DSAP</dt>
  <dd>
    The one-byte Destination Service Access Point to match.
  </dd>

  <dt>SSAP</dt>
  <dd>
    The one-byte Source Service Access Point to match.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>SNAP</h2>
SNAP frames are LLC frames with DSAP = 0xAA, SSAP = 0xAA and control field =
0x03.

The LLC fields are implicitly matched, while the SNAP protocol fields must be
explicitly configured.

<dl>
  <dt>SNAP Type</dt>
  <dd>
    This drop-down list holds the following selections:
    <ul>
      <li>RFC1042. If selected, the OUI will be set to 00:00:00</li>
      <li>802.1H. If selected, the OUI will be set to 00:00:F8</li>
      <li>Custom. If selected, the OUI can be specified directly in the OUI
          field</li>
    </ul>

    The primary purpose of providing this list of options is that people tend to
    forget often-used protocol OUIs. One may also simply select Custom and type
    e.g. the 802.1H OUI directly into the OUI field. But notice, that once this
    gets saved, the SNAP Type will change to 802.1H.
  </dd>

  <dt>OUI</dt>
  <dd>
    Only when the SNAP Type is set to Custom, will this field be editable. Type
    the OUI you with to match on as six hexadecimal digits, but omit the colon.
    All six characters must be specified.
  </dd>

  <dt>Protocol ID</dt>
  <dd>
     The SNAP header's Protocol ID (a.k.a. PID) is a 16-bit integer that can be
     entered as both a decimal and hexadecimal value.<br/>

     If SNAP Type is RFC1042, the Protocol ID must be an EtherType, that is, a
     value &gt;= 0x600.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>IPv4</h2>
IPv4 frames are identified by hardware by having an EtherType of 0x800.

With the IPv4 type, any IPv4 frame can be matched or one or more fields from the
IPv4 header and (in case of UDP/TCP frames), also the UDP/TCP destination port
can be matched. The fields are:

<dl>
  <dt>Source IP Address</dt>
  <dd>
    Specify an IPv4 address in dotted decimal format to match aginst the frames'
    IPv4 header's SIP field.<br/>

    Only if the Source IP Prefix Length is non-zero, will the frame be matched
    against a source IP address.
  </dd>

 <dt>Source IP Prefix Length</dt>
 <dd>
   Sets the number of bits in the Source IP address to match.<br/>

   If set to 0, no source IP matching will occur.<br/>
   If set to 32, all bits in the Source IP Address will be used.<br/>
   Otherwise, only the N first bits will be used in the matching, and the
   remaining bits will be cleared<br/>.

   The latter rule means that if you e.g. set the Source IP address to 1.2.3.4
   and the Prefix Length to 16 and hit the Save button, the ".3.4" part will be
   cleared, so that the IP address will be shown as 1.2.0.0.<br/>

   Many tend to forget to set the prefix length after having specified an IP
   address. Therefore, if the prefix length is zero while the IP address is
   non-zero, a confirmation dialog will be shown asking whether this is really
   what the user wants.
 </dd>

  <dt>Destination IP Address</dt>
  <dd>
    This is where you will specify the IPv4 header's DIP to match again.<br/>

    See Source IP Address above for details.
  </dd>

 <dt>Destination IP Prefix Length</dt>
 <dd>
   Sets the number of bits in the Destination IP address to match.<br/>

   See Source IP Prefix Length for details.
 </dd>

 <dt>DSCP Match</dt>
 <dd>
   One can choose to match on either any DSCP value, a given DSCP value, or a
   range of DSCP values. Which selection is chosen determines the editability of
   the following two inputs.
 </dd>

 <dt>DSCP Minimum</dt>
 <dd>
    If DSCP Match is set to Value, this input determines the DSCP value to use
    in the matching.<br/>

    If DSCP Match is set to Range, this input determines the lower value in the
    range used in the matching.<br/>

    Valid values are 0-63.<br/>

    If DSCP Match is set to Any, this input cannot be modified.
 </dd>

 <dt>DSCP Maximum</dt>
 <dd>
    If DSCP Match is set to Range, this input determines the higher value in the
    range used in the matching.<br/>

    Valid values are 0-63.<br/>

    If DSCP Match is set to Any or Value, this input cannot be modified.
 </dd>

 <dt>Fragment</dt>
 <dd>
   If the IPv4 headers MF (More Fragments) bit is set, or the Fragment Offset is
   non-zero, the IPv4 frame is considered a fragment.<br/>

   Set this drop-down list to Any to not using the fragment info for anything in
   the matching<br/>

   Set it to No to match IPv4 frames not considered fragments.<br/>

   Set it to Yes to match IPv4 frames considered fragments.
 </dd>

 <dt>Protocol Type</dt>
 <dd>
   The IPv4 header contains a one-byte Protocol field, which can be matched upon
   with this section.<br/>

   Set the drop-down list to Any to match any protocol field value.<br/>
   Set it to TCP to match on protocol field value 6.<br/>
   Set it to UDP to match on protocol field value 17.<br/>
   Set it to Custom to match on a custom protocol field value, which is input
   in the next field.</br>
 </dd>

 <dt>Protocol Value</dt>
 <dd>
   If the Protocol Type is set to Custom, this one-byte field is used to input
   the protocol fiel value to match against.<br/>

   This may also be set to the value of TCP (6) or UDP (17). Doing so and
   saving, causes the Protocol Type to change to the relevant value.
 </dd>

 <dt>TCP/UDP Destination Port Match</dt>
 <dd>
   In case the Protocol Type is set to UDP or TCP, it is also possible to match
   on these two protocols' 16-bit destination port fields.<br/>

   Set the drop-down list value to Any to match all destination ports<br/>
   Set it to Value to match a particular destination port.<br/>
   Set it to Range to match a range of destination ports.
 </dd>

 <dt>TCP/UDP Destination Port Minimum</dt>
 <dd>
    If TCP/UDP Destination Port Match is set to Value, this input determines the
    destination port value to use in the matching.
    in the matching.<br/>

    If it is set to Range, this input determines the lower value in the range
    used in the matching.<br/>

    Valid values are 0-65535.<br/>

    If The Match drop-down list is set to Any, this input cannot be modified.
 </dd>

 <dt>TCP/UDP Destination Port Maximum</dt>
 <dd>
    If TCP/UDP Destination Port Match is set to Range, this input determines the
    higher value in the range used in the matching.<br/>

    Valid values are 0-65535.<br/>

    If The Match drop-down list is set to Any or Value, this input cannot be
    modified.
 </dd>
</dl>

<h2>IPv6</h2>
IPv6 frames are identified by hardware by having an EtherType of 0x86dd.

With the IPv6 type, any IPv6 frame can be matched or one or more fields from the
IPv6 header and (in case of UDP/TCP frames), also the UDP/TCP destination port
can be matched. The fields are:

<dl>
  <dt>Source IP Address</dt>
  <dd>
    Specify an IPv6 address in standard IPv6 representation notations to match
    aginst the frames' IPv6 header's SIP field.<br/>

    Only if the Source IP Prefix Length is non-zero, will the frame be matched
    against a source IP address.
  </dd>

 <dt>Source IP Prefix Length</dt>
 <dd>
   Sets the number of bits in the Source IP address to match.<br/>

   If set to 0, no source IP matching will occur.<br/>
   If set to 128, all bits in the Source IP Address will be used.<br/>
   Otherwise, only the N first bits will be used in the matching, and the
   remaining bits will be cleared<br/>.

   The latter rule means that if you e.g. set the Source IP address to
   2001:db8::1 and the Prefix Length to 64 and hit the Save button, the ::1 part
   will be cleared, so that the IP address will be shown as 2001:db8::<br/>

   Many tend to forget to set the prefix length after having specified an IP
   address. Therefore, if the prefix length is zero while the IP address is
   non-zero, a confirmation dialog will be shown asking whether this is really
   what the user wants.
 </dd>

  <dt>Destination IP Address</dt>
  <dd>
    This is where you will specify the IPv6 header's DIP to match again.<br/>

    See Source IP Address above for details.
  </dd>

 <dt>Destination IP Prefix Length</dt>
 <dd>
   Sets the number of bits in the Destination IP address to match.<br/>

   See Source IP Prefix Length for details.
 </dd>

 <dt>DSCP Match</dt>
 <dd>
   One can choose to match on either any DSCP value, a given DSCP value, or a
   range of DSCP values. Which selection is chosen determines the editability of
   the following two inputs.
 </dd>

 <dt>DSCP Minimum</dt>
 <dd>
    If DSCP Match is set to Value, this input determines the DSCP value to use
    in the matching.<br/>

    If DSCP Match is set to Range, this input determines the lower value in the
    range used in the matching.<br/>

    Valid values are 0-63.<br/>

    If DSCP Match is set to Any, this input cannot be modified.
 </dd>

 <dt>DSCP Maximum</dt>
 <dd>
    If DSCP Match is set to Range, this input determines the higher value in the
    range used in the matching.<br/>

    Valid values are 0-63.<br/>

    If DSCP Match is set to Any or Value, this input cannot be modified.
 </dd>

 <dt>Protocol Type</dt>
 <dd>
   The IPv6 header contains a one-byte Protocol field, which can be matched upon
   with this section.<br/>

   Set the drop-down list to Any to match any protocol field value.<br/>
   Set it to TCP to match on protocol field value 6.<br/>
   Set it to UDP to match on protocol field value 17.<br/>
   Set it to Custom to match on a custom protocol field value, which is input
   in the next field.</br>
 </dd>

 <dt>Protocol Value</dt>
 <dd>
   If the Protocol Type is set to Custom, this one-byte field is used to input
   the protocol fiel value to match against.<br/>

   This may also be set to the value of TCP (6) or UDP (17). Doing so and
   saving, causes the Protocol Type to change to the relevant value.
 </dd>

 <dt>TCP/UDP Destination Port Match</dt>
 <dd>
   In case the Protocol Type is set to UDP or TCP, it is also possible to match
   on these two protocols' 16-bit destination port fields.<br/>

   Set the drop-down list value to Any to match all destination ports<br/>
   Set it to Value to match a particular destination port.<br/>
   Set it to Range to match a range of destination ports.
 </dd>

 <dt>TCP/UDP Destination Port Minimum</dt>
 <dd>
    If TCP/UDP Destination Port Match is set to Value, this input determines the
    destination port value to use in the matching.
    in the matching.<br/>

    If it is set to Range, this input determines the lower value in the range
    used in the matching.<br/>

    Valid values are 0-65535.<br/>

    If The Match drop-down list is set to Any, this input cannot be modified.
 </dd>

 <dt>TCP/UDP Destination Port Maximum</dt>
 <dd>
    If TCP/UDP Destination Port Match is set to Range, this input determines the
    higher value in the range used in the matching.<br/>

    Valid values are 0-65535.<br/>

    If The Match drop-down list is set to Any or Value, this input cannot be
    modified.
