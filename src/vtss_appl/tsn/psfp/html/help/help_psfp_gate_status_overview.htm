<h1>PSFP Stream Gate Status Overview Help</h1>

<p>This page provides an overview of the status of all
<a href="glossary.htm#psfp" class="glossary">PSFP</a> stream gate instances.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Stream Gate ID</dt>
  <dd>
    ID of the stream gate instance.
  </dd>

  <dt>Enabled</dt>
  <dd>
    This shows whether the gate is administratively enabled (Yes) or disabled
    (No). The remaining fields are only valid when the gate is enabled.
  </dd>

  <dt>Config Pending</dt>
  <dd>
    A stream gate can be configured to take on a set of parameters at a given
    time in the future. If that time has not been reached, this field will show
    the value "Yes", otherwise "No".<br/>

    Only filled in if the stream gate is enabled.
  </dd>

  <dt>State</dt>
  <dd>
    The operational value of the stream gate's gate state. It reads "Open" if
    the gate is open, "Closed" if closed.<br/>

    Only filled in if the stream gate is enabled.
  </dd>

  <dt>IPV</dt>
  <dd>
    The operational value of the Internal Priority Value for the gate. If
    "Disabled", use of IPV is not in effect. Otherwise it contains a value
    between 0 and 7, which in turn is used to direct the frame to a particular
    egress queue. If gate control lists are used, frames may later on get
    directed to other egress queues.<br/>

    Only filled in if the stream gate is enabled.
  </dd>

  <dt>Closed Due To Invalid Rx</dt>
  <dd>
    A stream gate may get permanently closed if receiving a frame during a
    closed gate state. This field reads "Yes" if this is the case, "No" if not.
    <br/>
    Click the "Clear" button to re-enable the gate. This button is only
    available if the gate is operationally enabled and is actually in this
    state.<br/>

    The field as such is only filled in if the stream gate is enabled.
  </dd>

  <dt>Closed Due To Octets Exceeded</dt>
  <dd>
    A stream gate may get permanently closed if receiving a frame that exceeds
    the configured Octet Max and the feature is enabled. This field reads "Yes"
    if this is the case, "No" if not.
    <br/>
    Click the "Clear" button to re-enable the gate. This button is only
    available if the gate is operationally enabled and is actually in this
    state.<br/>

    The field as such is only filled in if the stream gate is enabled.
  </dd>
</dl>
