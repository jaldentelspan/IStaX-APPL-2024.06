<h1>PSFP Stream Gate Status Details Help</h1>

<p>This page provides a detailed status of a particular
<a href="glossary.htm#psfp" class="glossary">PSFP</a> stream gate instance.</p>

At the top right corner a drop-down list allows for changing the stream gate
instance being shown.<br/>

The page contains two tables - one with various top-level stream gate status
details and another with operational, pending, and configured gate control list
details. The seconds table is only available if the stream gate is
administratively enabled.

<dl>
  <dt>Stream Gate ID</dt>
  <dd>
    ID of the stream gate instance.
  </dd>

  <dt>Enabled</dt>
  <dd>
    This shows whether the gate is administratively enabled (Yes) or disabled
    (No). The remaining fields are only valid when the gate is enabled.
  </dd>

  <dt>Config Pending</dt>
  <dd>
    A stream gate can be configured to take on a set of parameters at a given
    time in the future. If that time has not been reached, this field will show
    the value "Yes", otherwise "No".<br/>

    Only filled in if the stream gate is enabled.
  </dd>

  <dt>State</dt>
  <dd>
    The operational value of the stream gate's gate state. It reads "Open" if
    the gate is open, "Closed" if closed.<br/>

    Only filled in if the stream gate is enabled.
  </dd>

  <dt>IPV</dt>
  <dd>
    The operational value of the Internal Priority Value for the gate. If
    "Disabled", use of IPV is not in effect. Otherwise it contains a value
    between 0 and 7, which in turn is used to direct the frame to a particular
    egress queue. If gate control lists are used, frames may later on get
    directed to other egress queues.<br/>

    Only filled in if the stream gate is enabled.
  </dd>

  <dt>Closed Due To Invalid Rx</dt>
  <dd>
    A stream gate may get permanently closed if receiving a frame during a
    closed gate state. This field reads "Yes" if this is the case, "No" if not.
    <br/>
    Click the "Clear" button to re-enable the gate. This button is only
    available if the gate is operationally enabled and is actually in this
    state.<br/>

    The field as such is only filled in if the stream gate is enabled.
  </dd>

  <dt>Closed Due To Octets Exceeded</dt>
  <dd>
    A stream gate may get permanently closed if receiving a frame that exceeds
    the configured Octet Max and the feature is enabled. This field reads "Yes"
    if this is the case, "No" if not.
    <br/>
    Click the "Clear" button to re-enable the gate. This button is only
    available if the gate is operationally enabled and is actually in this
    state.<br/>

    The field as such is only filled in if the stream gate is enabled.
  </dd>

  <dt>Current Time</dt>
  <dd>
    When judging when a pending configuration is going to take place or has
    taken place, this field is valuable. It shows the hardware time as
    configured by PTP or - if not configured by PTP - the time since boot.<br/>

    It shows the time both in seconds and in ISO 8601 format.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Operational, Pending, and Configured Configuration</h2>

A stream gate has three sets of configuration:

<ul>
  <li>
    Operational - the configuration that is currently in effect.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pending - the configuration that is going to take effect at some point in
    the future.
  </li>
  <li>
    Configured - configuration that is not yet set to be pending.
  </li>
</ul>

After the first enabling of the stream gate, the operational configuration
may still not be in effect if "Config Change" has not been set or if the base
time is configured to be out in the future. In this case, the Operational
column contains dashes ("-") in most fields, except for the "Control List
Length", because the stream gate indeed is enabled and the top-level parameters
(hereunder the Control List Length) are in effect.<br/>

Likewise, if there is no pending configuration - either because "Config Change"
has never been set since the gate got enabled or because the configured base
time when "Config Change" was set is now in the past - the Pending column
contains dashes ("-") in all fields.<br/>

The Configured column always contains what the user has configured.

<dl>
  <dt>Config Change Time</dt>
  <dd>
    For the operational column, this holds the time (in seconds and ISO 8601
    format) when the configuration took effect.<br/>

    For the pending column, this holds the configured base time when "Config
    Change" was set.<br/>

    For the configured column, this holds the last configured base time.
  </dd>

  <dt>Cycle Time</dt>
  <dd>
    This shows the operational, pending, and configured cycle time along with
    its units.
  </dd>

  <dt>Cycle Time Extension</dt>
  <dd>
    This shows the operational, pending, and configured cycle time extension
    along with its units.
  </dd>

  <dt>Control List Length</dt>
  <dd>
    This shows the operational, pending, and configured control list lengths.
    <br/>

    The individual control list indices are only shown for the operational,
    pending, and configured columns if the index is smaller than the configured
    control list length for the configuration set.
  </dd>

  <dt>Control List Index "X" Gate State</dt>
  <dd>
    This shows the operational, pending, and configured Gate State for control
    list index "X".
  </dd>

  <dt>Control List Index "X" IPV</dt>
  <dd>
    This shows the operational, pending, and configured Internal Priority Value
    for control list index "X".
  </dd>

  <dt>Control List Index "X" Time Interval</dt>
  <dd>
    This shows the operational, pending, and configured time interval along with
    its units for control list index "X".
  </dd>

  <dt>Control List Index "X" Octet Max</dt>
  <dd>
    This shows the operational, pending, and configured maximum number of octets
    for control list index "X".
  </dd>
</dl>
