<h1>PSFP Stream Gate Configuration Overview Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect the current
<a href="glossary.htm#psfp" class="glossary">PSFP</a> stream gate
configurations, along with options to add, edit or delete such configurationas.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Stream Gate ID</dt>
  <dd>
    The ID of this stream gate instance.
  </dd>

  <dt>Enabled</dt>
  <dd>
    Indicates whether the stream gate is active (Enabled = Yes) or inactive
    (Enabled = No).
  </dd>

  <dt>Gate State</dt>
  <dd>
    The administrative value of the GateStates parameter for the stream gate.
  </dd>

  <dt>Cycle Time</dt>
  <dd>
    The administrative value of the cycle time for the gate in either
    milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds.
  </dd>

  <dt>Cycle Time Extension</dt>
  <dd>
    The administrative value of the cycle time extension parameter for the gate
    in either milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds.
  </dd>

  <dt>Base Time Seconds/ISO 8601</dt>
  <dd>
    The administrative value of the BaseTime parameter for the gate.<br/>

    The &quot;Seconds&quot; value indicates the time in seconds and subseconds
    since epoch where the configuration is configured to change - if
    the Config Change flag has been issued.<br/>

    The &quot;ISO 8601&quot; value represents the same, but is displayed as a
    string formatted according to
    <a href="glossary.htm#iso8601" class="glossary">ISO 8601</a>.<br/>
  </dd>

  <dt>IPV</dt>
  <dd>
    The administrative value of the IPV parameter for the gate.
  </dd>

  <dt>Control List Length</dt>
  <dd>
    The number of entries in the Gate Control List.
  </dd>

  <dt>Close Gate Due To Invalid Rx</dt>
  <dd>
    If checked, the stream gate gets permanently closed if receiving a frame
    during a closed gate state.
  </dd>

  <dt>Close Gate Due To Octets Exceeded</dt>
  <dd>
    If checked, the stream gate gets permanently closed if receiving a frame
    that exceeds the configured Octet Max.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Configuration Buttons</h2>
<dl>
  <dd>
    On the right hand side of each stream gate, you find two buttons:<br/>
    <img src="../images/edit.gif" alt="Edit">: Click to edit this stream gate.<br/>
    <img src="../images/del.gif"  alt="Delete">: Click to delete this stream
    gate (happens immediately without confirmation).<br/><br/>

    The very last row in the table also contains a button:<br/>
    <img src="../images/add.gif" alt="Add">: Click to create a new stream gate.
 </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p><input type="button" value="Refresh">: Click to refresh the page immediately. This is useful if the stream gate configuration has been changed from e.g. CLI.</p>
