<h1>PSFP Stream Gate Configuration Help</h1>

This page allows the user to inspect and modify current
<a href="glossary.htm#psfp" class="glossary">PSFP</a> stream gate
configurations, along with options to create new.<br/>

At the top right corner, the page offers a drop-down list, where any of the
existing stream gates can be selected. Notice that if you have changed contents
of a stream gate without saving and then change to another stream gate, the
changes will be lost without confirmation.<br/>

The page is divided into three sections, as outlined below.

<h2>Gate Configuration </h2>
This part contains parameters that take effect immediately after the
configuration is saved - whether or not the next section's "Config Change"
checkbox is checked.

<dl>
  <dt>Stream Gate ID</dt>
  <dd>
    The ID of this gate instance.<br/>

    If editing an existing stream gate, this field is not editable, but it is if
    adding a new.<br/>

    If attempting to save a new stream gate with an ID already in use, a
    confirmation box will be shown.
  </dd>

  <dt>Enable</dt>
  <dd>
    If checked, the stream gate is active in hardware. Otherwise it is inactive.
  </dd>

  <dt>Gate State</dt>
  <dd>
    The gate's initial state.
  </dd>

  <dt>IPV</dt>
  <dd>
    Select the frames initial priority value (egress queue). It may be overriden
    by a control list entry later.<br/>

    If set to Disabled, the the frame's classified priority will be used to
    point out the egress queue - also unless overridden by a control list entry
    later).
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Gate Configuration 2</h2>
This section configures properties of the stream gate that only take effect when
the gate is enabled and the "Config Change" checkbox is checked. Whether the
configuration becomes pending or applied directly to hardware depends on whether
the configured Base Time is in the past (takes effect immediately) or in the
future (becomes pending, and only takes effect when the Base Time is reached).

<dl>
  <dt>Cycle Time</dt>
  <dd>
    Set the gate's cycle time. A cycle time of up to 1 second can be specified.
    The Cycle Time consists of a value and a unit (milliseconds, microseconds,
    or nanoseconds).<br/>

    The cycle time cannot be set lower than the sum of all the enabled gate
    control list entries' Time Interval.
  </dd>

  <dt>Cycle Time Extension</dt>
  <dd>
    Set the gate's cycle time extension. Up to 1 second can be specified, in the
    same manner as the Cycle Time.
  </dd>

  <dt>Base Time</dt>
  <dd>
    The administrative value of the BaseTime parameter for the gate.<br/>

    The value must be specified in seconds an optional dot (.) and up to 9
    digits indicating the subseconds.<br/>

    The current time can be seen in the next field (Current Time) if you are not
    creating a new stream gate. This can be used to judge what to set the Base
    Time to. If setting it to a time in the past, the configuration will take
    effect immediately after you have checked the "Config Change" checkbox and
    clicked Save. Otherwise, the configuration will become pending, and only
    take effect when Current Time reached Base Time.
  </dd>

  <dt>Current Time</dt>
  <dd>
    To assist in judging what to set the Base Time to or judge when an existing
    stream gate configuration will take effect, the current time is displayed
    in two formats:<br/>

    The &quot;Seconds&quot; value indicates the time in seconds and subseconds
    since epoch.<br/>

    The &quot;ISO 8601&quot; value represents the same, but is displayed as a
    string formatted according to
    <a href="glossary.htm#iso8601" class="glossary">ISO 8601</a>.<br/>
  <dd>

  <dt>GCL Length</dt>
  <dd>
    Length of the gate control list.<br/>

    The number of enabled items in the "Gate Control List Configuration" section
    depends on the chosen gate control list length.
  <dd>

  <dt>Close Gate Due To Invalid Rx</dt>
  <dd>
    If checked, the stream gate gets permanently closed if receiving a frame
    during a closed gate state.
  </dd>

  <dt>Close Gate Due To Octets Exceeded</dt>
  <dd>
    If checked, the stream gate gets permanently closed if receiving a frame
    that exceeds a gate control list entry's "Octet Max".
  </dd>

  <dt>Config Change</dt>
  <dd>
    This is the one-shot parameter that - when checked and the Save button is
    clicked - causes the current configuration to take effect or become pending.
    <br/>

    This will always be unchecked when the page gets refreshed.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Gate Control List Configuration</h2>
This section allows for configuring the individual gate control list entries.
The number of editable items depends on the selected value of "GCL Length" in
the previous section.<br/>
Changes will only take effect (or become pending) when the previous section's
Config Change is checked and the Save button is clicked.

<dl>
  <dt>Index</dt>
  <dd>
    The index of the gate control entry. These are zero-based.
  </dd>

  <dt>Gate State</dt>
  <dd>
    Selects the gate's state during this entry's active period.
  </dd>

  <dt>IPV</dt>
  <dd>
    Use this (Internal Priority Value) to force frames arriving during this
    gate's active period to a particular egress queue.<br/>

    Set to "Disabled" to let the frame keep its current IPV.
  </dd>

  <dt>Time Interval</dt>
  <dd>
    Select this control list entry's active period.<br/>

    The value cannot exceed 999,999,999 nanoseconds and the sum of the time
    interval for all enabled gate control list entries cannot exceed the gate's
    cycle time.
  </dd>

  <dt>Octet Max</dt>
  <dd>
    Select the maximum frame size that may arrive in this entry's active period.
    Set to 0 to allow any frame size.<br/>

    If a frame's size exceeds the configured maximum size, it gets discarded.
    On top of this, if the "Close Gate Due To Octets Exceeded" is checked,
    subsequent frames also get discarded until administratively opened again
    (on the PSFP Stream Gate's Status page).
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p><input type="button" value="Save">:    Click to save changes.</p>
<p><input type="button" value="Reset">:   Click to undo any changes made locally and revert to previously saved values.</p>
<p><input type="button" value="Back">:    Return to the previous page. Any changes made locally will be lost.</p>
<p><input type="button" value="Refresh">: Click to refresh the page immediately. Any changes made locally will be lost. This is useful if the stream configuration has been changed from e.g. CLI.</p>
