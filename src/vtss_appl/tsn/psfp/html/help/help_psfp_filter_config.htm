<h1>PSFP Stream Filter Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect, add and change
<a href="glossary.htm#psfp" class="glossary">PSFP</a> configurations.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Delete</dt>
  <dd>
    Click to delete the stream filter instance. It will be deleted right away
    without any request for confirmation.<br/>

    If the stream filter was added with a click on the Add button, it is simply
    removed again.
  </dd>

  <dt>Stream Filter ID</dt>
  <dd>
    An ID uniquely identifying the stream filter. Valid values are in the
    range 0 to <span id="InstanceMax">?</span>.<br/>

    This can only be changed if adding a new stream filter.
  </dd>

  <dt>Stream Type</dt>
  <dd>
    PSFP allows for two different methods for specifying streams that should map
    to this PSFP stream filter instance.<br/>

    The first, "Stream", allows for setting one particular stream ID.<br/>

    The second, "Stream Collection", allows for specifying an ID of a stream
    collection. A stream collection compiles multiple streams into one single.
    <br/>

    The two methods are mutually exclusive.
  </dd>

  <dt>Stream ID</dt>
  <dd>
    Specify the ID of the stream that should map to this PSFP stream filter.
    <br/>

    This field is only available if "Stream Type" is set to "Stream ID".
  </dd>

  <dt>Stream Collection ID</dt>
  <dd>
    Specify the ID of a stream collection that should map to this PSFP stream
    filter.<br/>

    This field is only available if "Stream Type" is set to "Stream Collection".
  </dd>

  <dt>Flow Meter Enable</dt>
  <dd>
    Check this to enable setting a Flow Meter ID that this stream filter will
    use.
  </dd>

  <dt>Flow Meter ID</dt>
  <dd>
    The ID of the Flow Meter that this stream filter will use.<br/>

    This field is only available if "Flow meter Enable" is checked.
  </dd>

  <dt>Stream Gate Enable</dt>
  <dd>
    Check this to enable setting a Stream Gate ID that this stream filter will
    use.
  </dd>

  <dt>Stream Gate ID</dt>
  <dd>
    The ID of the Stream Gate that this stream filter will use.<br/>

    This field is only available if "Stream Gate Enable" is checked.
  </dd>

  <dt>Maximum SDU Size</dt>
  <dd>
    The maximum allowed frame size for the filter.<br/>

    Any frame exceeding this value will be discarded.<br/>

    A value of 0 disables this feature.
  </dd>

  <dt>Block Oversize Frame Enable</dt>
  <dd>
     Whenever a frame gets discarded because its SDU size is greater than the
     configured Maximum SDU Size, this one control what shapp happen with
     subsequenct frames that go through the stream filter.<br/>

     If checked, subsequent frames will also be discarded whether they are
     larger or smaller than the configured Maximum SDU Size. Otherwise they will
     remain being subject to only the Maximum SDU Size check - if enabled.<br/>

     An administrative action is required to reset the discarting. Use the
     PSFP Stream Filter Status page to perform this action.
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="warnings">Warnings</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Configuration of a stream filter may result in configurational warnings.
    <br/>

    For instance, if a stream filter is neither assigned to a Flow Meter nor a
    Stream Gate, it is not of any use, and a warning will appear.<br/>
    any use, and a warning will appear.<br/>

    A color indicates the warning state as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
         <img src="../images/led-off.gif" alt="gray"/>:
         The stream filter is not yet created
       </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../images/led-up.gif" alt="green"/>:
        The stream filter has no configurational warnings
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../images/led-yellow.gif" alt="yellow"/>:
        The stream filter has at least one configurational warning
      </li>
    </ul>

    When yellow, hover the mouse over the image to see a list of
    configurational warnings. The possible warnings are as follows:
    <span id="configurational_warnings">?</span><br/>
  </dd>
