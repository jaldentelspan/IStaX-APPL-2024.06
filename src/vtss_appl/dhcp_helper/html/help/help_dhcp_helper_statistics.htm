<h1>DHCP Detailed Statistics Help</h1>
<p>This page provides statistics for <a href="glossary.htm#dhcp_snooping" class="glossary">DHCP snooping</a>.
   Notice that the normal forward per-port TX statistics isn't increased if the incoming DHCP packet is done by L3 forwarding mechanism.
   And clear the statistics on specific port may not take effect on global statistics since it gathers the different layer overview.
