Microchip is aware that some terminology used in this directory and its
subdirectories is antiquated and inappropriate. As a result of the complex
nature of software where seemingly simple changes have unpredictable, and often
far-reaching negative results on the software's functionality (requiring
extensive retesting and revalidation) we are unable to make the desired changes
in all legacy systems without compromising our product or our clients' products.
