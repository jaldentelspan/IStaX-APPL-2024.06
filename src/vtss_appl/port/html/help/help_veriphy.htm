<h1>VeriPHY Help</h1>

<h2><a name="veriphy">VeriPHY</a></h2>

<p>This page is used for running the VeriPHY Cable Diagnostics for 10/100 and 1G copper ports.</p>

<p>Press <input type="button" value=" Start "> to run the diagnostics. 
  This will take approximately 5 seconds. If all ports are selected, this can take approximately 15 seconds. 
  When completed, the page refreshes automatically, and you can view the cable diagnostics results in the
  cable status table. Note that VeriPHY is only accurate for cables of length 7 - 140 meters.<br/>
  10 and 100 Mbps ports will be linked down while running VeriPHY. Therefore, running VeriPHY on
  a 10 or 100 Mbps management port will cause the switch to stop responding until VeriPHY is complete.
</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">The ports belong to the currently selected stack
unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>
