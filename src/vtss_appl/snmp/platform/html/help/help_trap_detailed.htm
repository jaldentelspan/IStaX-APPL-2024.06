<dl>
 <dt>Trap Config Name</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates which trap Configuration's name for configuring. The allowed string length is 1 to <span id="trapHostLen">255</span>, and the allowed content is ASCII characters from 33 to 126.
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMP mode operation. Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable SNMP mode operation.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable SNMP mode operation.
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Version</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMP supported version. Possible versions are:
 <br><samp>SNMP v1</samp>: Set SNMP supported version 1.
 <br><samp>SNMP v2c</samp>: Set SNMP supported version 2c.
 <br><samp>SNMP v3</samp>: Set SNMP supported version 3.
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Community</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the community access string when sending SNMP trap packet. The allowed string length is 0 to <span id="snmpCommunityLen">255</span>, and the allowed content is ASCII characters from 33 to 126. 
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Destination Address</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMP trap destination address. It allow a valid IP address in dotted decimal notation ('x.y.z.w').
 </dd>
 <dd class="has_dns">
 And it also allow a valid hostname.

 </dd>

 <dd class="has_ipv6">
 Indicates the SNMP trap destination IPv6 address. IPv6 address is in 128-bit records represented as eight fields of up to four hexadecimal digits with a colon separating each field (:).
 For example, 'fe80::215:c5ff:fe03:4dc7'.
 The symbol '::' is a special syntax that can be used as a shorthand way of representing multiple 16-bit groups of contiguous zeros; but it can appear only once.
 It can also represent a legally valid IPv4 address. For example, '::192.1.2.34'.
 </dd>

 <dt>Trap Destination port</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMP trap destination port. SNMP Agent will send SNMP message via this port, the port range is 1~65535.
