<dl>
 <dt>Mode</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMP mode operation. Possible modes are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Enable SNMP mode operation.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Disable SNMP mode operation.
 </dd>

 <dt>Engine ID</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the SNMPv3 engine ID.
The string must contain an even number(in hexadecimal format) with number of digits between 10 and 64, but all-zeros and all-'F's are not allowed. Only users on this Engine ID can access the device (local users), so changing the Engine ID will revoke access for all current local users.
