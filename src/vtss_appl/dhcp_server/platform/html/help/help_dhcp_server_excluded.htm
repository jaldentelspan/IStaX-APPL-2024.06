            DHCP server will not allocate these excluded IP addresses to DHCP client.

            <dt>IP Range</dt>
            <dd>
                Define the IP range to be excluded IP addresses.
                The first excluded IP must be smaller than or equal to the second excluded IP.
                BUT, if the IP range contains only 1 excluded IP, then you can just input
                it to either one of the first and second excluded IP or both.
