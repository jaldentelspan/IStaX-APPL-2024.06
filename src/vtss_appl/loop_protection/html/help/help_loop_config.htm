<dl>
 <dt>Enable Loop Protection</dt>
 <dd>
   Controls whether loop protections is enabled (as a whole).
 </dd>

 <dt>Transmission Time</dt>
 <dd>
   The interval between each loop protection PDU sent on each port.
   Valid values are 1 to 10 seconds. Default value is 5 seconds.
 </dd>

 <dt>Shutdown Time</dt>
 <dd>
   The period (in seconds) for which a port will be kept disabled in
   the event of a loop is detected (and the port action 
   shuts down the port). Valid values are 0 to 604800 seconds
   (7 days). A value of zero will keep a port disabled (until next
   device restart). Default value is 180 seconds.
