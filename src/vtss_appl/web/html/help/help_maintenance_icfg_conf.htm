<h1>Maintenance Help</h1>

<h2><a name="configuration">Configuration</a></h2>

<p>The switch stores its configuration in a number of text files in CLI format.
 The files are either virtual (RAM-based) or stored in flash on the switch.
</p>
<p>The available files are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>running-config</i>: A virtual file that represents the currently active
        configuration on the switch. This file is volatile.</li>
    <li><i>startup-config</i>: The startup configuration for the switch, read at
        boot time. If this file doesn't exist at boot time, the switch will start
        up in default configuration.</li>
    <li><i>default-config</i>: A read-only file with vendor-specific configuration.
        This file is read when the system is restored to default settings.</li>
    <li>Up to <script type="text/javascript">document.write(configIcfgRwFilesMax - 1);</script> other
        files, typically used for configuration backups or alternative
        configurations.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="save">Save <i>startup-config</i></a></h3>
<p>This copies <i>running-config</i> to <i>startup-config</i>, thereby ensuring
that the currently active configuration will be used at the next reboot.
</p>

<h3><a id="download">Download</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to download any of the files on the switch to the web browser.
Select the file and click <input type="button" value="Download Configuration">.
<br>Download of <i>running-config</i> may take a little while to complete, as the file
must be prepared for download.
</p>

<h3><a id="upload">Upload</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to upload a file from the web browser to all the files on the
switch, except <i>default-config</i> which is read-only.<br>
Select the file to upload, select the destination file on the target, then click
<input type="button" value="Upload Configuration">.
</p>
<p>If the destination is <i>running-config</i>, the file will be applied to the
switch configuration. This can be done in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Replace mode: The current configuration is fully replaced with the
    configuration in the uploaded file.</li>
    <li>Merge mode: The uploaded file is merged into <i>running-config</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the flash file system is full (i.e. contains <i>default-config</i> and
<script type="text/javascript">document.write(configIcfgRwFilesMax);</script> other files, usually including
<i>startup-config</i>), it is not possible to create new files. Instead an existing
file must be overwritten or another file must be deleted.
</p>

<h3><a id="activate">Activate</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to activate any of the configuration files present on the
switch, except for <i>running-config</i> which represents the currently active
configuration.<br>
Select the file to activate and click <input type="button" value="Activate Configuration">.
This will initiate the process of completely replacing the existing configuration
with that of the selected file.
</p>
<h3><a id="delete">Delete</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to delete any of the writable files stored in flash, including
<i>startup-config</i>. If this is done and the switch is rebooted without a
prior Save operation, this effectively resets the switch to default configuration.
