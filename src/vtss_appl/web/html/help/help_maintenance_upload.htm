<h2><a name="upload">Software Upload</a></h2>

<p>This page facilitates an update of the firmware controlling the
<span class="SPOM_only">stack.</span>
<span class="Standalone_only">switch.</span>
</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">Uploading software will update all managed
switches in the stack.</p>

<div class="hasWarmStart">
 <input type="checkbox" name="coolStart" id="coolstart1">
 <label for="coolstart1">Force Cool Restart</label>
 <p>
  Uncheck "Force Cool Restart" if you want to perform a warm restart of the 
  <span class="SPOM_only">stack</span>
  <span class="Standalone_only">switch</span>
  after the software upload.
  <br>
  Check "Force Cool Restart" if you want to simulate a power-on (cold restart) of the
  <span class="SPOM_only">stack</span>
  <span class="Standalone_only">switch</span>
  after the software upload.
  <br>
  <i><b>Warning</b>: Forcing a cool restart will affect the traffic going through the 
  <span class="SPOM_only">stack.</span>
  <span class="Standalone_only">switch.</span>
  </i>
 </p>
</div>

<p><input type="button" value=" Browse "> to the location of a software image and click <input type="button" value=" Upload ">.</p>

<p>After the software image is uploaded, a page announces that the
firmware update is initiated.  After about a minute, the firmware is
updated and
<span class="SPOM_only">all managed switches in the stack restart.</span>
<span class="Standalone_only">the switch restarts.</span></p>

<p><i><b>Warning</b>: While the firmware is being updated, Web access
appears to be defunct. The front LED flashes Green/Off with a
frequency of 10 Hz while the firmware update is in progress. <b>Do not
restart or power off the device at this time</b> or the switch may fail
to function afterwards.</i></p>
