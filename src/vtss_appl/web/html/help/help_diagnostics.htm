<h2><a name="ping">Ping (IPv4)</a></h2>

<p>This page allows you to issue <a href="glossary.htm#icmp" class="glossary">ICMP</a> (IPv4) <a href="glossary.htm#ping" class="glossary">PING</a> packets to troubleshoot <a href="glossary.htm#ip" class="glossary">IP</a> connectivity issues.</p>

<p>You can configure the following parameters for the test:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Hostname or IP Address</dt>
 <dd>
 The address of the destination host, either as a symbolic hostname or an IP Address.
 </dd>
 <dt>Payload Size</dt>
 <dd>
 Determines the size of the ICMP data payload in bytes (excluding the size of Ethernet, IP and ICMP headers). The default value is 56 bytes.
 The valid range is 2-1452 bytes.
 </dd>
 <dt>Payload Data Pattern</dt>
 <dd>
 Determines the pattern used in the ICMP data payload. The default value is 0. The valid range is 0-255.
 </dd>
 <dt>Packet Count</dt>
 <dd>
 Determines the number of PING requests sent. The default value is 5. The valid range is 1-60.
 </dd>
 <dt>TTL Value</dt>
 <dd>
 Determines the Time-To-Live /TTL) field value in the IPv4 header. The default value is 64. The valid range is 1-255.
 </dd>
<dt>VID for Source Interface</dt>
 <dd>
 This field can be used to force the test to use a specific local VLAN interface as the source interface.
 Leave this field empty for automatic selection based on routing configuration.
 <p>Note: You may only specify either the VID or the IP Address for the source interface.</p>
 <dt>Source Port Number</dt>
 <dd>
 This field can be used to force the test to use a specific local interface with the specified port number as the source interface.
 The specified port must be configured with a suitable IP address. Leave this field empty for automatic selection based on routing configuration.
 <p>Note: You may only specify either the Source Port Number or the IP Address for the source interface.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Address for Source Interface</dt>
 <dd>
 This field can be used to force the test to use a specific local interface with the specified IP address as the source interface.
 The specified IP address must be configured on a local interface. Leave this field empty for automatic selection based on routing configuration.
 <p>Note: You may only specify either the VID or the IP Address for the source interface.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Quiet (only print result)</dt>
 <dd>
Checking this option will not print the result of each ping request but will only show the final result.
 </dd>
</dl>

<p>After you press <input type="button" value=" Start ">, ICMP packets are transmitted, and the sequence number and
    round trip time are displayed upon reception of a reply. </p>
<p>The amount of data received inside of an IP packet of type ICMP ECHO_REPLY will always be 8 bytes more 
    than the requested payload data size (the difference is the ICMP header).</p>
<p>The page refreshes automatically until responses to all packets are received, or until a timeout occurs.</p>

<p>The output from the command will look like the following:</p>
<pre>
PING 172.16.1.1 (172.16.1.1) from 172.16.1.10: 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.16.1.1: seq=0 ttl=64 time=2.034 ms

64 bytes from 172.16.1.1: seq=4 ttl=64 time=1.916 ms

Traceroute (IPv4)
-->

<h2><a name="traceroute">Traceroute (IPv4)</a></h2>

<p>This page allows you to perform a <b>traceroute</b> test over IPv4 towards a remote host. <b>traceroute</b> is a diagnostic tool for
    displaying the route and measuring transit delays of packets across an IPv4 network.</p>

<p>You can configure the following parameters for the test:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Hostname or IP Address</dt>
 <dd>
 The destination IP Address.
 </dd>
 <dt>DSCP Value</dt>
 <dd>
 This value is used for the DSCP value in the IPv4 header. The default value is 0. The valid range is 0-63.
 </dd>
 <dt>Number of Probes Per Hop</dt>
 <dd>
 Determines the number of probes (packets) sent for each hop. The default value is 3. The valid range is 1-60.
 </dd>
 <dt>Response Timeout</dt>
 <dd>
 Determines the number of seconds to wait for a reply to a sent request. The default number is 3. The valid range is 1-86400.
 </dd>
 <dt>First TTL Value</dt>
 <dd>
 Determines the value of the Time-To-Live (TTL) field in the IPv4 header in the first packet sent. The default number is 1. The valid range is 1-30.
 </dd>
 <dt>Max TTL Value</dt>
 <dd>
 Determines the maximum value of the Time-To-Live (TTL) field in the IPv4 header. If this value is reached before the
 specified remote host is reached the test stops. The default number is 30. The valid range is 1-255.
 </dd>
<dt>VID for Source Interface</dt>
 <dd>
 This field can be used to force the test to use a specific local VLAN interface as the source interface.
 Leave this field empty for automatic selection based on routing configuration.
 <p>Note: You may only specify either the VID or the IP Address for the source interface.</p>
 <dt>Address for Source Interface</dt>
 <dd>
 This field can be used to force the test to use a specific local interface with the specified IP address as the source interface.
 The specified IP address must be configured on a local interface. Leave this field empty for automatic selection based on routing configuration.
 <p>Note: You may only specify either the VID or the IP Address for the source interface.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Use ICMP instead of UDP</dt>
 <dd>
 By default the <b>traceroute</b> command will use UDP datagrams. Selecting this option forces it to use ICMP ECHO packets instead.
 </dd>
 <dt>Print Numeric Addresses</dt>
 <dd>
 By default the <b>traceroute</b> command will print out hop information using a reverse DNS lookup for the acquired host ip addresses.
 This may slow down the display if the DNS information is not available. Selecting this option will prevent the reverse DNS lookup
 and force the <b>traceroute</b> command to print numeric IP addresses instead.
