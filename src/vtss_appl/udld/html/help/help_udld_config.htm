<h1>UDLD Port Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows the user to inspect the current  <a href="glossary.htm#UDLD" class="glossary">UDLD</a>
configurations, and possibly change them as well.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   Port number of the switch.
 </dd>

 <dt>UDLD Mode</dt>
 <dd>
   Configures the <a href="glossary.htm#UDLD" class="glossary">UDLD</a> mode on a port.
   Valid values are <samp>Disable</samp>, <samp>Normal</samp> and <samp>Aggressive</samp>. Default mode is Disable.
   <h3> Disable </h3>
   In disabled mode, <a href="glossary.htm#UDLD" class="glossary">UDLD</a> functionality doesn't exists on port.
   <h3> Normal </h3>
   In normal mode, if the link state of the port was determined to be unidirectional, it will not affect the port state.
   <h3> Aggressive </h3>
   In aggressive mode, unidirectional detected ports will get shutdown. To bring back the ports up, need to disable <a href="glossary.htm#UDLD" class="glossary">UDLD</a>
   on that port.
 </dd>

 <dt>Message Interval</dt>
 <dd>
   Configures the period of time between <a href="glossary.htm#UDLD" class="glossary">UDLD</a> probe messages on
   ports that are in the advertisement phase and are determined to be bidirectional. The range is from 7 to 90 seconds(Default value is 7 seconds)(Currently default time interval is supported, due to lack of detailed information in RFC 5171).
