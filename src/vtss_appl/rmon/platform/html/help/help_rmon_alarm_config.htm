<h1>RMON Alarm Configuration Help</h1>

<h2>RMON Alarm Configuration</h2>

<p>Configure RMON Alarm table on this page. The entry index key is <samp>ID</samp>.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Delete</dt>
 <dd>
 Check to delete the entry. It will be deleted during the next save.
 </dd>

 <dt>ID</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the index of the entry.
 The range is from 1 to 65535.
 </dd>
  <dt>Interval</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the interval in seconds for sampling and comparing the rising and falling threshold.
 The range is from 1 to 2^31-1.
 </dd>

 <dt>Variable</dt>
 <dd>
 Indicates the particular variable to be sampled, the possible variables are:<br>
 <samp>InOctets</samp>: The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters.<br>
 <samp>InUcastPkts:</samp> The number of uni-cast packets delivered to a higher-layer protocol.<br>
 <samp>InNUcastPkts</samp>: The number of broad-cast and multi-cast packets delivered to a higher-layer protocol.<br>
 <samp>InDiscards</samp>: The number of inbound packets that are discarded even the packets are normal.<br>
 <samp>InErrors</samp>: The number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol.<br>
 <samp>InUnknownProtos</samp>: the number of the inbound packets that were discarded because of the unknown or un-support protocol.<br>
 <samp>OutOctets</samp>: The number of octets transmitted out of the interface , including framing characters.<br>
 <samp>OutUcastPkts</samp>: The number of uni-cast packets that request to transmit. <br>
 <samp>OutNUcastPkts</samp>: The number of broad-cast and multi-cast packets that request to transmit.<br>
 <samp>OutDiscards</samp>: The number of outbound packets that are discarded event the packets is normal.<br>
 <samp>OutErrors</samp>: The The number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. <br>
 <samp>OutQLen</samp>: The length of the output packet queue (in packets).
 </dd>

 <dt>Sample Type</dt>
 <dd>
 The method of sampling the selected variable and calculating the value to be compared against the thresholds, possible sample types are:<br>
 <samp>Absolute</samp>: Get the sample directly.<br> 
 <samp>Delta</samp>: Calculate the difference between samples (default).
 </dd>

 <dt>Value</dt>
 <dd>
 The value of the statistic during the last sampling period.<br>
 </dd>

 <dt>Startup Alarm</dt>
 <dd>
 The method of sampling the selected variable and calculating the value to be compared against the thresholds, possible sample types are:<br>
 <samp>Rising</samp>Trigger alarm when the first value is larger than the rising threshold.<br> 
 <samp>Falling</samp>Trigger alarm when the first value is less than the falling threshold.<br>
 <samp>RisingOrFalling</samp>Trigger alarm when the first value is larger than the rising threshold or less than the falling threshold (default).
 </dd>

 <dt>Rising Threshold</dt>
 <dd>
 Rising threshold value (-2147483648-2147483647).
 </dd>
 <dt>Rising Index</dt>
 <dd>
 Rising event index (0-65535). If this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index.
 </dd>
 <dt>Falling Threshold</dt>
 <dd>
 Falling threshold value (-2147483648-2147483647)
 </dd>
 <dt>Falling Index</dt>
 <dd>
 Falling event index (0-65535). If this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index.
 </dd>
