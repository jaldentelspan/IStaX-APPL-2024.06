      <dd>The current status of the server. This field takes one of the following values:<br/>

        <samp>Ready</samp>: The server is enabled, IP communication is up and running, and the RADIUS module is ready to accept access attempts.<br/>
        <samp>Dead (X seconds left)</samp>: Access attempts were made to this server, but it did not reply within the configured timeout.
              The server has temporarily been disabled, but will get re-enabled when the dead-time expires. The number of seconds left before this
              occurs is displayed in parentheses. This state is only reachable when more than one server is enabled.
