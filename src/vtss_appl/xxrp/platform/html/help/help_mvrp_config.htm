<h1>MVRP Global and Port Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page allows you to configure the <a href="glossary.htm#mvrp" class="glossary">MVRP</a> global and per port settings altogether. The page is divided into a global section and
 a per-port configuration section<span class="SPOM_only">. Notice that the port configuration section reflects the configuration for the selected switch in the stack</span>.
</p>

<h2>MVRP Global Configuration</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Global State</dt>
  <dd>
    Enable or disable the <a href="glossary.htm#mvrp" class="glossary">MVRP</a> protocol
    globally. This will enable or disable the protocol globally and at the same time
    on the switch ports that are MVRP enabled.
  </dd>

  <dt>Managed VLANs</dt>
  <dd>
    This field shows the managed VLANs, i.e. the VLANs that MVRP will operate upon.
    By default, only VLANs <span class="vlan_min">?</span>-
    <span class="vlan_max">?</span> are managed, i.e. the entire range as defined in
    IEEE802.1Q-2014 for MVRP. However this range can be limited by using a list syntax
    where the individual elements are separated by commas. Ranges are specified with
    a dash separating the lower and upper bound.<br/>
    The following example will create VLANs 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 200, and 300: <samp>1,10-13,200,300</samp>. Spaces are allowed in between the delimiters.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>MVRP Port Configuration</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   The port number for which the following configuration applies.
 </dd>

 <dt>Enabled</dt>
 <dd>
    Enable or disable the <a href="glossary.htm#mvrp" class="glossary">MVRP</a> protocol
    on this switch port. This will enable or disable the protocol on the switch port
    given that MVRP is also globally enabled.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p><input type="button" value="Save">: Click to save changes.</p>
<p><input type="button" value="Reset">: Click to undo any changes made locally and revert to previously saved values.</p>
