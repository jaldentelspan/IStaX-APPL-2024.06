<h1>MVRP Statistics Help</h1>

<p>This page provides statistics for the <a href="glossary.htm#mvrp" class="glossary">MVRP</a>
   protocol for all switch ports.
</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">The settings relate to the currently selected stack unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
   The logical port for the statistics contained in the same row.
 </dd>

 <dt>Failed Registrations</dt>
 <dd>
   The number of failed VLAN registrations on this switch port.
   Each port implementing the <a href="glossary.htm#mvrp" class="glossary">MVRP</a> protocol
   maintains a count of the number of times it has received a VLAN registration request
   but has failed to register the VLAN due to lack of space in the Filtering Database. 
 </dd>

 <dt>Last PDU Origin</dt>
 <dd>
   The MAC address of the most recent <a href="glossary.htm#mvrp" class="glossary">MVRP</a>
   PDU received on this switch port. MAC is 00-00-00-00-00-00 if the protocol is not enabled
   on that switch port, or if the port has not received any MVRP PDUs yet.
 </dd>
</dl>
