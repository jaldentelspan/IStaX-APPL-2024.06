<h1>ACL Ports Configuration Help</h1>

<p>Configure the ACL parameters (<a href="glossary.htm#ace" class="glossary">ACE</a>) of each switch port. These parameters will affect frames received on a port unless the frame matches a specific ACE.</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">The settings relate to the currently selected stack
unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Port</dt>
 <dd>
 The logical port for the settings contained in the same row.
 </dd>

 <dt>Policy ID</dt>
 <dd>
 Select the policy to apply to this port. The allowed values are <samp>0</samp> through <samp><span id="AclPolicyMax">7</span></samp>. The default value is 0.
 </dd>

 <dt>Action</dt>
 <dd>
 Select whether forwarding is permitted ("Permit") or denied ("Deny"). The default value is "Permit".
 </dd>

 <dt>Rate Limiter ID</dt>
 <dd>
 Select which rate limiter to apply on this port. The allowed values are <samp>Disabled</samp> or the values <samp>1</samp> through <samp><span id="AclRateLimitIdMax">15</span></samp>. The default value is "Disabled".
 </dd>

 <dt>Port Redirect</dt>
 <dd>
  Select which port frames are redirected on. The allowed values are <samp>Disabled</samp> or a specific port number and it can't be set when action is permitted. The default value is "Disabled".
 </dd>

 <dt class="acl_v2_only">Mirror</dt>
 <dd class="acl_v2_only">
 Specify the mirror operation of this port. The allowed values are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Frames received on the port are mirrored.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Frames received on the port are not mirrored.
 <br>The default value is "Disabled".
 </dd>

 <dt class="acl_log_only">Logging</dt>
 <dd class="acl_log_only">
 Specify the logging operation of this port. Notice that the logging message doesn't include the 4 bytes CRC. The allowed values are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: Frames received on the port are stored in the System Log.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Frames received on the port are not logged.
 <br>The default value is "Disabled".
 Note: The logging feature only works when the packet length is less than 1518(without VLAN tags)
 and the System Log memory size and logging rate is limited.
 </dd>

 <dt class="acl_shutdown_only">Shutdown</dt>
 <dd class="acl_shutdown_only">
 Specify the port shut down operation of this port. The allowed values are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: If a frame is received on the port, the port will be disabled.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: Port shut down is disabled.
 <br>The default value is "Disabled".
 <br> Note: The shutdown feature only works when the packet length is less than 1518(without VLAN tags).
 </dd>

 <dt>State</dt>
 <dd>
 Specify the port state of this port. The allowed values are:
 <br><samp>Enabled</samp>: To reopen ports by changing the volatile port configuration of the ACL user module.
 <br><samp>Disabled</samp>: To close ports by changing the volatile port configuration of the ACL user module.
 <br>The default value is "Enabled".
 </dd>

 <dt>Counter</dt>
 <dd>
 Counts the number of frames that match this ACE.
 </dd>
</dl>
