<h1>IGMP Snooping Configuration Help</h1>

<p>This page provides <a href="glossary.htm#igmp" class="glossary">IGMP</a> Snooping related configuration.</p>

<p class="SPOM_only">Most of the settings are global, whereas the <a href="glossary.htm#router_port" class="glossary">Router Port</a> configuration is related to the currently selected stack unit, as reflected by the page header.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Snooping Enabled</dt>
 <dd>
 Enable the Global IGMP Snooping.
 </dd>

 <dt>Unregistered IPMCv4 Flooding Enabled</dt>
 <dd>
 Enable unregistered IPMCv4 traffic flooding.<br/>
 The flooding control takes effect only when IGMP Snooping is enabled.<br/>
 When IGMP Snooping is disabled, unregistered IPMCv4
 traffic flooding is always active in spite of this setting.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">IGMP SSM Range</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 SSM (Source-Specific Multicast) Range allows the SSM-aware hosts and routers
 run the SSM service model for the groups in the address range.<br/>
 Requests made by IGMPv1 and IGMPv2 hosts in this range are ignored.<br/>
 Assign a valid IPv4 multicast address as prefix with a prefix length (from 4 to
 32) for the range.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">Leave Proxy Enabled</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Enable IGMP Leave Proxy. This feature can be used to avoid forwarding unnecessary leave messages to the router side.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">Proxy Enabled</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Enable IGMP Proxy. This feature can be used to avoid forwarding unnecessary join and leave messages to the router side.
 </dd>

 <dt>Router Port</dt>
 <dd>
 Specify which ports act as router ports. A router port is a port on the Ethernet switch that leads towards the Layer 3 multicast device or <a href="glossary.htm#igmp_querier" class="glossary">IGMP querier</a>.
 <br>If an <a href="glossary.htm#aggregation" class="glossary">aggregation</a> member port is selected as a router port, the whole aggregation will act as a router port.
 </dd>

 <dt><a href="glossary.htm#multicast_fastleave" class="glossary">Fast Leave</a></dt>
 <dd>
 Enable the fast leave on the port.<br>
 System will remove group record and stop forwarding data upon receiving the IGMPv2 leave message without sending last member query messages.<br>
 It is recommended to enable this feature only when a single IGMPv2 host is connected to the specific port.
 </dd>

 <dt class="has_smb_ipmc">Throttling</dt>
 <dd class="has_smb_ipmc">
 Enable to limit the number of multicast groups to which a switch port can belong.
 </dd>
