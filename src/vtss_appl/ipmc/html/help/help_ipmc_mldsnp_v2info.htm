<h1>MLD SFM Information Table</h1>

<p>
  This page shows the <a href="glossary.htm#mld" class="glossary">MLD</a>
  registered multicast entries sorted by VLAN ID, group address, port number
  and source address.
</p>

<h2> Navigating the MLD SFM Information Table</h2>
<p>
  Each page shows up to 99 entries from the MLD SFM Information table, default being 20,
  selected through the "entries per page" input field. When first visited, the web page will show the first 20 entries
  from the beginning of the MLD SFM Information Table.<br/>
  The "Start from <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a>", and "group" input fields allow the user to select the
  starting point in the MLD SFM Information Table.
  Clicking the <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button will update the displayed table starting from
  that or the closest next MLD SFM Information Table match. In addition, the two input fields will -
  upon a <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button click - assume the value of the first displayed entry,
  allowing for continuous refresh with the same start address.<br/>
  The <input type="button" value=" >> "/> will use the last entry of the currently displayed table as a basis for
  the next lookup. When the end is reached the text "No more entries" is shown in the
  displayed table. Use the <input type="button" value=" |<<"/> button to start over.
</p>

<h2>MLD SFM Information Table Columns</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>VLAN ID</dt>
  <dd>
    VLAN ID of the group.
  </dd>

  <dt>Group</dt>
  <dd>
    Group address of the group displayed.
  </dd>

  <dt>Port</dt>
  <dd>
    Switch port number.
  </dd>

  <dt>Mode</dt>
  <dd>
    Each &lt;VLAN ID, Group, Port&gt; has a filter mode of either Include or
    Exclude, described further in section 7.2.1 of RFC3810.
  </dd>

  <dt>Source Address</dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="glossary.htm#ip" class="glossary">IP</a> Address of the source.<br/>

    If there are no specific source addresses the text is &quot;&lt;
    Any&gt;&quot;. This may happen if a host on the port is in MLDv1 mode or
    simply hasn't specified particular sources in the MLDv2 reports.<br/>

    On the contrary, if there indeed <b>are</b> sources in the MLDv2 reports,
    there is also a &quot;Catch-remaining&quot; entry, which matches on source
    addresses not already specified above its line. This is marked with &quot;
    &lt;Other&gt;&quot;.<br/>

    Currently, the maximum number of IPv6 source address per VLAN ID per group
    is 8.<br/>
  </dd>

  <dt>Type</dt>
  <dd>
    This field indicates whether the entry is forwarding (Allow) or blocking
    (Deny).
  </dd>

  <dt>Hardware Filter/Switch</dt>
  <dd>
     Shows whether blocking/forwarding of this entry is handled by hardware or
     not.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<p>Auto-refresh
<input type="checkbox">: Automatic refresh occurs every <span class="refreshInterval">?</span> seconds.</p>

<p><input type="button" value="Refresh">: Refreshes the displayed table starting from the input fields.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" |<< ">: Updates the table starting from the first entry in the MLD SFM Information Table.</p>
<p><input type="button" value=" >> ">: Updates the table, starting with the entry after the last entry currently displayed.</p>
