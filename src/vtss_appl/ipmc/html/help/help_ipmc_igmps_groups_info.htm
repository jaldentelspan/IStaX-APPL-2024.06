<h1>IGMP Group Table</h1>

<p>
  Entries in the <a href="glossary.htm#igmp" class="glossary">IGMP</a> Group Table are shown on this page.
  The IGMP Group Table is sorted first by <a href="glossary.htm#vlan_id" class="glossary">VLAN ID</a>, and then by group.<br/>
</p>

<h2> Navigating the IGMP Group Table</h2>
<p>
  Each page shows up to 99 entries from the IGMP Group table, default being 20, selected through the
  "entries per page" input field. When first visited, the web page will show the first 20 entries from
  the beginning of the IGMP Group Table.<br/>
  The "Start from <a href="glossary.htm#vlan" class="glossary">VLAN</a>", and "group" input fields allow the user to select the
  starting point in the IGMP Group Table.
  Clicking the <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button will update the displayed table starting from
  that or the closest next IGMP Group Table match. In addition, the two input fields will -
  upon a <input type="button" value="Refresh"/> button click - assume the value of the first displayed entry,
  allowing for continuous refresh with the same start address.<br/>
  The <input type="button" value=" >> "/> will use the last entry of the currently displayed table as a basis for
  the next lookup. When the end is reached the text "No more entries" is shown in the
  displayed table. Use the <input type="button" value=" |<<"/> button to start over.
</p>
