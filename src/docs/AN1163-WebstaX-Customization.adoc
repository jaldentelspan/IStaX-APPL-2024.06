= Linux Customizations

This document will present a collection of options to customize the firmware
images managed by WebStaX software project (SW) used in ENT switch products.
All facilities presented here do not require source code access for the SW but
do require a Board Support Package (BSP), and can be used to customize without
recompiling the WebStaX image. This document will mostly focus on simple
customization facilities. For more advanced customization, knowledge of embedded
Linux and C programming is required.

The document will first present a set of customization facilities that can be
used and combined. After this it will provide a few use cases with examples on
how the different facilities may be used.

== Facilities

This section includes a number of different facilities that can be used to
customize a firmware image for a product in the WebStaX family.

=== Modular Firmware Images

Modular Firmware Images (MFI) is a new image type that is being introduced with
the Linux based version of the WebStaX family. The modular firmware architecture
is designed to be flexible and allow the user to replace and append various
components without the need to recompile/rebuild all the components.

The MFI file consists of two parts, a `stage1` and a `stage2`. `stage1` as a
minimum must include a `kernel` and a `initrd` section. `stage2` may include a
number of root file system elements. `stage1` must be accessible by the
boot-loader. `stage2` on the other hand is loaded by the `initrd` application
after the `kernel` has booted the system. This may be used to locate the root
filesystem (which is the majority of the image file) in the NAND flash not
accessible by the boot-loader.

`stage2` of the firmware image includes parts that are being used to build the
final root file system. Each root file system element is *just* `xz` compressed
`tarball` file with a small header. The `initrd` application in the `stage1`
section, will iterate through the root file system elements, and extract each of
the associated tarballs into a ram file system. The file system entries will be
processed in the order they are located in the file, meaning that a later
element can overwrite files in an earlier element.

The script called `mfi.rb` is being provided as part of the BSP, and it should be
used to build, alter and/or inspect the MFI files. Start by validating that the
`mfi.rb` is installed and able to run:

----
$ mfi.rb --help
Usage: mfi [global-options] [<command> [command-specific-options]]
    -i, --input  <file>              Firmware image to read. New image is created if not specified.
    -o, --output  <file>             Firmware image to write.
    -k, --public-key  <file>         Use public key for validation.
    -v, --verbose  <lvl>             Set verbose level.
    -d, --dump                       Dump the inventory of TLV(s) in the firmware image.
    -V, --version                    Print the version of this program and exit.

Commands:
  help         Prints this help message.
  stage1       Inspect or alter the stage1 area of the firmware image.
  bootloader   Inspect or alter any bootloader tlv in the firmware image.
  rootfs       Inspect or alter the rootfs tlv(s) in the firmware image.
----

The `mfi.rb` script must be included in the search path. This script is
distributed as part of the BSP, and is installed at:
`/opt/mscc/mscc-brsdk-mips-vXX.YY/stage1/x86_64-linux/usr/bin/mfi.rb` where
`XX.YY` represents the version of the BSP. This section will
assume it to be part of the search path.

==== Firmware File Format

*Note: This section documents the binary file format used by MFI. This is
provided as background information, most people should be able to just use the
`mfi.rb` tool to inspect, read and write `mfi` files.*

MFI uses a binary file format. The file starts with the `stage1` part, the
optional `stage2` follows immediately after `stage1`.

Both `stage1` and `stage2` are using the following `typedef` for little endian
integers:
[source,c]
    typedef uint32_t mscc_le_u32;

The file format of `stage1` and `stage2` is documented below.

===== Stage 1

The binary `stage1` header is defined by the following:

[source,c]
----
typedef struct mscc_firmware_vimage {
    mscc_le_u32 magic1;         // 0xedd4d5de
    mscc_le_u32 magic2;         // 0x987b4c4d
    mscc_le_u32 version;        // 0x00000001

    mscc_le_u32 hdrlen;         // Header length
    mscc_le_u32 imglen;         // Total image length (stage1)

    char machine[32];           // Machine/board name
    char soc_name[32];          // SOC family name
    mscc_le_u32 soc_no;         // SOC family number

    mscc_le_u32 img_sign_type;  // Image signature algorithm. TLV has
                                // signature data

    // After <hdrlen> bytes;
    // struct mscc_firmware_vimage_tlv tlvs[0];
} mscc_firmware_vimage_t;
----

Immediately after the `stage1` header is a number of `stage1` Type Length Value (TLV). Each `TLV`
follows the following format (no padding between `TLVs`):

[source,c]
----
typedef struct mscc_firmware_vimage_tlv {
    mscc_le_u32 type;      // TLV type (mscc_firmware_image_stage1_tlv_t)
    mscc_le_u32 tlv_len;   // Total length of TLV (hdr, data, padding)
    mscc_le_u32 data_len;  // Data length of TLV
    u8          value[0];  // Blob data
} mscc_firmware_vimage_tlv_t;
----

The following enum documents the list of `TLVs` supported:

[source,c]
----
typedef enum {
    MSCC_STAGE1_TLV_KERNEL      = 0,
    MSCC_STAGE1_TLV_SIGNATURE   = 1,
    MSCC_STAGE1_TLV_INITRD      = 2,
    MSCC_STAGE1_TLV_KERNEL_CMD  = 3,
    MSCC_STAGE1_TLV_METADATA    = 4,
    MSCC_STAGE1_TLV_LICENSES    = 5
} mscc_firmware_image_stage1_tlv_t;
----

The following enum documents the list of signatures supported:

[source,c]
----
typedef enum {
    MSCC_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_MD5    = 1,
    MSCC_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_SHA256 = 2,
    MSCC_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_SHA512 = 3,
} mscc_firmware_image_signature_t;
----

The signature covers the whole `stage1` `TLVs`. This `digital signature scheme`
is calculated based on `OpenSSL` `RSA`.

===== Stage 2

The `stage2` part does not have a common header, it is "just" a sequence of
`stage2` `TLVs`. The `stage2` `TLV` header looks like this:

[source,c]
----
typedef struct mscc_firmware_vimage_s2_tlv {
    mscc_le_u32 magic1;    // 0xa7b263fe
    mscc_le_u32 type;      // TLV type (mscc_firmware_image_stage2_tlv_t)
    mscc_le_u32 tlv_len;   // Total length of TLV (hdr, data, padding)
    mscc_le_u32 data_len;  // Data length of TLV
    mscc_le_u32 sig_type;  // Signature type
                           // (mscc_firmware_image_signature_t)
    u8          value[0];  // Blob data
} mscc_firmware_vimage_stage2_tlv_t;
----


In contrast to `stage1` `TLVs`, then `stage2` `TLVs` embed the signature
directly into each `TLV`. This means that the `stage2` `TLVs` is signed
individually. The binary layout is as follows:

----
                                                       20 + data_len
0       4      8        12         16          20      |           tlv_len
+-------+------+---------+----------+-----------+------+-----------+
| magic | type | tlv_len | data_len | sige_type | data | signature |
+-------+------+---------+----------+-----------+------+-----------+
----

The supported `stage2` `TLV` types are documented by the following enumeration
(currently only `ROOTFS` is supported):

[source,c]
----
typedef enum {
    MSCC_STAGE2_TLV_ROOTFS = 2,
} mscc_firmware_image_stage2_tlv_t;
----

====== Root file system element `ROOTFS`

The root file system element `TLV` type is 2. The root file system element is
optional and may be repeated, meaning that a given firmware image may include
between zero and *N* of these elements. The data content of this `TLV` is a new
`TLV` area using the following header:

    0      4        8   Length + 8
    +------+--------+------+
    | Type | Length | Data |
    +------+--------+------+

Following is the list of `sub-tlv` types supported by the root file system
elements:

1. **Name:** An ASCII encoded string with the name of this element.
2. **Version:** An ASCII encoded string with the version information of this
   element.
3. **License terms:** An ASCII encoded string with the license terms of this
   element.
4. **PreExec** An executable that is being invoked before the `tar`
   archive is extracted into the root file system. *Not implemented in
   current release*.
5. **Content:** A `xz` compressed `tar` archive with the root file
   system content.
6. **PostExec:** An executable that is being invoked after the `tar`
   archive is extracted into the root file system. *Not implemented in
   current release*.

If the firmware image includes more than one root file system elements, then the
content of those is being merged. If the same file(s) is present in multiple
archives, then it is the content from the last archive that wins.

==== Tool Support `mfi.rb`

The `MFI` command line tool is used to construct and inspect the firmware
images. It also supports appending/replacing the contents to an existing
firmware image. It is written in `Ruby`, hence it should be working across
platforms (`WIN`, `OSX` and `LINUX`) as long as `Ruby` is supported and properly
installed.

`MFI` tool includes a number of different submodules for different operations on
the firmware images.

[source, shell]
----
$ mfi -help
Usage: mfi [global-options] [<command> [command-specific-options]]
    -i, --input  <file>              Firmware image to read. New image is created if not specified.
    -o, --output  <file>             Firmware image to write.
    -k, --public-key  <file>         Use public key for validation.
    -v, --verbose  <lvl>             Set verbose level.
    -d, --dump                       Dump the inventory of TLV(s) in the firmware image.
    -V, --version                    Print the version of this program and exit.
    -c, --collect-sha  <file>        Collect sha's to file when doing dump.

Commands:
  help         Prints this help message.
  stage1       Inspect or alter the stage1 area of the firmware image.
  bootloader   Inspect or alter any bootloader tlv in the firmware image.
  rootfs       Inspect or alter the rootfs tlv(s) in the firmware image.
----

*Note*: `MFI` tool currently supports submodules are shown below, more
 submodules might be added in the future.

* stage1
* bootloader
* rootfs

Add submodule name for further help information on a specific submodule.

[source, shell]
----
$ ## mfi <submodule> -help
$ mfi stage1 -help
Usage: stage1 [options]
    -a, --kernel-get <file>          Extract the kernel from the firmware image, and write it to <file>.
    -b, --kernel-set <file>          Update the kernel blob in the firmware image with the raw content of <file>.
    -c, --initrd-get <file>          Extract the initrd from the firmware image and write it to <file>.
    -d, --initrd-set <file>          Update the initrd blob in the firmware image with the raw content of <file>.
    -e, --metadata-get <file>        Extract the metadata blob from the firmware image and write it to <file>.
    -f, --metadata-set <file>        Update the metadata blob in the firmware image with the raw content of <file>.
    -m, --machine <string>           Set the machine string in the image..
    -w, --soc-name <string>          Set the soc-name string in the image..
    -n, --soc-no <string>            Set the soc-no string in the image..
    -k, --kernel-command <string>    Set the kernel command line in the image..
    -l, --license-terms <file>       Update the licenses blob in the firmware image with the raw content of <file>.
    -s, --sign-data <type> <keyfile> Sign data with (RSA) key
----

Let's take a look at how `stage1` is normally composed.

[source, shell]
----
mfi.rb -o <output_file_name>.mfi stage1 \
       --kernel-set <path_to_kernel_file> \
       --initrd-set <path_to_initrd_file> \
       --kernel-command "init=/usr/bin/stage1-loader loglevel=4" \
       --metadata-set <path_to_metadata_file> \
       --license-terms <path_to_licensedata_file> \
       --machine <machine_name> \
       --soc-name <soc_name> \
       --soc-no <soc_number>
----

In the example above, `--kernel-command` can also be adjusted as needed of
course. Since `stage1` is the first component in the firmware image, there is no
input file (annotated as `-i`).

Upon execution, `<output_file_name>.mfi`, with all `stage1` components
in place, will be created.

The other submodules like `rootfs` is added in the same
manner. `<new_output_file_name>.mfi` could be same as the input file.

[source, shell]
----
mfi.rb -i <output_file_name>.mfi -o <new_output_file_name>.mfi rootfs\
       --action append \
       --name "rootfs" \
       --version "SDK_VERSION" \
       --file <path_to_rootfs_file>.tar.xz
----


=== ServiceD

ServiceD is a service manager. The switch application and other user
applications are all considered as services which will be spawned, monitored and
managed by ServiceD.

==== Service Configuration File

Each service is spawned according to its configuration file, located in the
`/etc/mscc/service/` folder. The configuration file follows certain formats.

The following is an example of a ServiceD configuration file:

----
# Start of config file
# Comment line starts with '#'
# This is an example configuration file called
# /etc/mscc/service/switch_app.service
name = switch_app
type = service
on_error = reboot
env = LD_PRELOAD=/lib/btsig.so
env = FOO=bar
env = Hello=world
# depend =
cmd = /usr/bin/switch_app
ready_file = /tmp/switch_app.ready
----

Notice the LD_PRELOAD line above: It causes the btsig shared object to be
loaded when the application (here "switch_app") and any of its descendant
processes execute. btsig registers a signal handler for a range of signals for
the program it hooks into. If one of the signals handled by btsig is raised by
the program, btsig will print a stack backtrace along with the command line and
thread/process IDs. The list of signals captured by btsig is: SIGINT, SIGQUIT,
SIGILL, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGPWR, SIGUSR1, and SIGUSR2. If either of the
three latter is raised (e.g. with "kill -USR1 <pid>"), execution will continue
after the stack backtrace has been printed. Otherwise it will exit with
EXIT_FAILURE. The program that btsig hooks into may install its own handler for
one or more of these signals. This will override btsig's handler.
Two more environment variables control how btsig works. The first,
BTSIG_OUT_FILE, if set, will cause btsig to write to this file instead of
writing to stdout. The second, BTSIG_ERR_FILE, if set, will cause btsig to write
to this file rather than to stderr.

==== Appearance and Requirements

The following table lists all the fields that is allowed in a ServiceD
configuration file. ServiceD will *NOT* start a service that has an faulty
configuration.

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===

| Fields
| Appearance & Requirements
| Description

| `name`
| Must appear once
| Name of service (only used for debugging and logging).

| `type`
| Allow once
| Type of service. Allowed values are `service` and `oneshot`.  `service` is a
long running process that by default will be auto-restarted by ServiceD, if it
exits. Its ready file will be also deleted until it is ready again.  `oneshot`
process will be seen as ready and its ready file, if any, will be created, if
its process executes and exits normally with return code 0. Otherwise it will,
by default, be respawned until it exits normally. The default behavior of the
actions taken when a service exits, can be altered with the `on_error` field.

| `on_error`
| Allow once
| Controls what happens if or when a ServiceD-controlled process terminates
unexpectedly. Valid values for this field are `respawn`, `reboot`, and `ignore`.
`respawn` (which is the default if not specified) causes a process to be
re-started.
`reboot` causes the system to be rebooted.
`ignore` does nothing.
The semantics of "process terminates unexpectedly" differ bewteen a long-lived
and a one-shot process: For a long-lived process, the `on_error` action is taken
whether or not the process got terminated by a signal or exited itself with any
return code. For a one-shot process, the `on_error` action is taken only if the
process terminates by a signal or exits with a non-zero return code.

| `env`
| Allow zero or more
| Specify environment variables to be set for the given service. Must follow
syntax: `key=val`

| `cmd`
| Must appear once
| Specify the command to invoke.

| `depend`
| Allow zero or more
| A list of services, this service depends on. The service will not be started
before all its dependencies are ready.

| `ready_file`
| Allow once
| Specifies a file that the service can use to flag that it is ready. The
ServiceD application will poll the availability of the file, and the
service is not considered ready until the `ready_file` exists. This is only
used when `type` is `service`.

| `serviced_profile`
| Allow once
| Profile of service. Any string is allowed. Only services with the targeted
  profile will be spawned by `ServiceD`. `webstax` is the default profile if
  nothing is specified in the service configuration file. `debug` can be
  speficied in the kernel command line so as to start the linux shell for debug
  purpose.

|===

==== Booting ServiceD profiles

To boot an alternative ServiceD profile, break the system in RedBoot, load the
linux partition, and add `serviced_profile=debug` to the Linux kernel command
string (assuming you want to boot the debug profile). See example below:

----

=== JSON-IPC

The Switch Application includes a JSON Inter-Process Communication (IPC) module
providing an IPC service to other applications. This IPC can be used for two purposes:

* The User Application can send JSON requests and receive corresponding JSON
  responses for normal configuration or monitoring purposes.
* The User Application can add/delete registrations for event notifications. If
  a registered event occurs, the Switch Application will send a JSON notification
  message to the User Application.

----
+-----------+       +-----------+
|  Switch   |<----->|    User   |
|Application|       |Application|
+-----------+       +-----------+
----

==== IPC Message Format

The JSON IPC has the following properties:

* The IPC uses a Unix domain socket bound to `/var/run/json_ipc.socket`.
* The exchanged messages consist of two parts:
** Length: 4 byte data length field in native CPU endianness.
** Data: JSON message with the length above. JSON notification registration is
   done using these method names:
*** Add registration: "jsonIpc.config.notification.add".
*** Delete registration: "jsonIpc.config.notification.del".

----
0        4     4 + length
+--------+--------------+
| length | JSON Message |
+--------+--------------+
----

==== JSON Message Examples

The following examples only show the JSON message part of the JSON IPC message,
i.e., the length field is not included.  First a normal request-response
communication is shown (get system information):

[source,json]
----
User Application -> Switch Application:
{"method":"systemUtility.config.systemInfo.get",
 "params":[],
 "id":"json_ipc"}

Switch Application -> User Application:
{"id":"json_ipc",
 "error":null,
 "result":{"Hostname":"my-switch",
           "Contact":"",
           "Location":""}}
----

Next, an event registration (port status update), an event notification (link
up) and an event deregistration (port status update) is shown:

[source,json]
----
User Application -> Switch Application:
{"method":"jsonIpc.config.notification.add",
 "params":["port.status.update"],
 "id":"json_ipc"}

Switch Application -> User Application:
{"method":"port.status.update",
 "id":null,
 "params":[{"event-type":"modify",
            "key":"Gi 1/1",
            "val":{"Link":false,
                   "Fdx":true,
                   "Fiber":false,
                   "Speed":"speed1G",
                   "SFPType":"none",
                   "SFPVendorName":"",
                   "SFPVendorPN":"",
                   "SFPVendorRev":"",
                   "LossOfSignal":false,
                   "TxFault":false,
                   "Present":false,
                   "SFPVendorSN":""}}]}

User Application -> Switch Application:
{"method":"jsonIpc.config.notification.del",
 "params":["port.status.update"],
 "id":"json_ipc"}
----

=== Boot-time Configuration
The Switch Application includes a number of features, which can be disabled
at boot-time. This may be done if a given feature is not desired or if it is
preferred to implement the feature outside the Switch Application.
The following features can currently be disabled:

* CLI via console port
* CLI via Telnet
* CLI via SSH
* SNMP
* Web handlers
* Web server

The boot-time configuration is done in `/etc/switch.conf` on the system.
This file does not exist by default, but may be added to the image using an MFI file.
The format of the file is JSON-based as shown below. In this example, SSH
and Web handlers are disabled at boot-time.

[source,json]
----
{
  "cli":{
    "enable":true,
  },
  "ssh":{
    "enable":false,
  },
  "snmp":{
    "enable":true
  },
  "telnet":{
    "enable":true
  },
  "web":{
    "enable":true,
    "handlers":false
  }
}
----
== Use Cases

=== Custom Web

The Web pages are added as a TLV section by default. Therefore it is
very easy to customize Web by replacing the default Web by a
customized one.

In this use case, a simple HTML file capable of showing port
status via JSON interface will be demonstrated.

==== Create, Compress New Web
Execute the following script to create a custom web file.

.custom_web.sh

=== Quagga Integration

`Quagga` is a routing software suite supporting most of the main routing
protocols such as RIP, OSPF, etc. It contains several daemons, one for
each protocol, and one called `zebra` for interface declaration and
static routing. In this use case, we will spawn `zebra` as a static
routing daemon via `ServiceD`.

First a `quagga.service` configuration file, telling `ServiceD` how to start
and manage it, is necessary. Then we will cross compile and build
`zebra` from a `quagga` release. Appending it upon a `WebStaX`
release is the last step.

==== Service Configuration File

A simple 'quagga' service configuration file could be:

.quagga.service
[source, txt]
----
name = quagga
type = service
depend = switch_app
cmd = /usr/sbin/zebra -f /etc/quagga/zebra.conf -i /tmp/q.pid
----

You will need to put this file under `/tmp/quagga_install/etc/mscc/service` on
your development PC, create these directories if needed. It will eventually be
compressed into the final MFI image.

**NOTE**: do not append "-d" or "--daemon" in the "cmd" line, as ServiceD will
do it implicitely.

==== Configure, Compile and Install

Besides the service configuration file, we need to have quagga configured,
compiled and installed for the target device.

===== Configure

Certain environment variables need to be set correctly as the very first step,
such as `PATH`, `GCC`, `LD`, etc.

.build_quagga.sh
[source, shell]
----
export PATH="/opt/mscc/mscc-brsdk-mips-vXX.XX/stage2/smb/x86_64-linux/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin"

export LD="mipsel-buildroot-linux-uclibc-ld"
export CC="mipsel-buildroot-linux-uclibc-gcc"
export GCC="mipsel-buildroot-linux-uclibc-gcc"
export STRIP="mipsel-buildroot-linux-uclibc-strip"
export CFLAGS=" -I/tmp/quagga_install/usr/include/"
export LDFLAGS=" -L/tmp/quagga_install/usr/lib/"

## Make sure MSCC SDK is in place via checking gcc version
$GCC --version
if [ "$?" -ne 0 ]
then
    echo "PATH is wrong!"
    exit 1
fi
----

A MSCC SDK that is supporting `ServiceD` has to be correctly set in `PATH`.

Like compiling any Linux software that comes with source code you may simply
follow the usual procedure, i.e.,

.build_quagga.sh
[source, shell]
----
./configure \
    --target=mipsel-buildroot-linux-uclibc \
    --host=mipsel-buildroot-linux-uclibc \
    --build=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu \
    --prefix=/tmp/quagga_install/usr \
    --sysconfdir=/tmp/quagga_install/etc \
    --localstatedir=/tmp \
    --enable-user=root \
    --enable-group=root \
    --program-prefix="" \
    --enable-zebra
 make
 make install
----

As http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/docs/docs-info.html#Sample-Config-File[User
manual @ *Quagga*] mentioned, `zebra.conf` file is needed to start `zebra` and
it should be placed under `/tmp/quagga_install/etc/quagga` folder.

.zebra.conf
[source, txt]
----
hostname Router
password zebra
enable password zebra
interface lo
interface sit0
log file zebra.log
----

The very last step of `build_quagga.sh` is to compress all the files for later
appending it by mfi.rb script.

.build_quagga.sh
[source, shell]
----
## Clean up
rm -rf /tmp/quagga_install/usr/share
rm -rf /tmp/quagga_install/usr/include

## Copy service config file, zebra daemon config file
mkdir -p /tmp/quagga_install/etc/mscc/service
cp quagga.service /tmp/quagga_install/etc/mscc/service/.
mkdir /tmp/quagga_install/etc/quagga
cp zebra.conf /tmp/quagga_install/etc/quagga/.

## Compress with the correct dir hierarchy
tar -C /tmp/quagga_install/ -vc usr etc -f quagga.tar
/usr/bin/xz --check=none quagga.tar
----

At this point, there should be a file named `quagga.tar.xz` generated.

==== Append

This can be automated by utilizing script `append_quagga.sh` below. We assume
that the user already has a valid MFI image `<targeted switch>.mfi` for the
targeted device and the mfi.rb script is in place as well.

.append_quagga.sh
[source, shell]
----
/<mfi script dir>/mfi.rb \
    -i <targeted switch>.mfi \
    -o <targeted switch>_quagga.mfi rootfs \
    --action append \
    --name "quagga_zebra" \
    --file /<some dir>/quagga.tar.xz
----

Now the final MFI image named `<targeted switch>_quagga.mfi` in this case is
available for use.

Load it on the target device and issue the commands below. As the
log shown, `ServiceD` successfully spawned `zebra` daemon.

[source, log]
----
# platform debug allow
# debug system shell
/ # ps
PID   USER     COMMAND

   95 root     /usr/sbin/zebra -f /etc/quagga/zebra.conf -i /tmp/q.pid
----

It is also possible to telnet to zebra port-2601 of the device from
your development PC now, see log below. Hostname and password are
set in the `zebra.conf` file we have defined previously.
[source, shell]
----

        .sun_family = AF_UNIX,                  // Socket type
        .sun_path = "/var/run/json_ipc.socket"  // Path of the JSON_IPC pipe
    };

    int s = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0); // create socket
    connect(s, (struct sockaddr *)&remote, sizeof(remote)); // connect it

    int i = strlen(msg);
    write(s, &i, sizeof(i));        // Write size of message
    write(s, msg, i);               // Write message

    read(s, &i, sizeof(i));         // Read sizeof response
    char *res = calloc(i + 1, 1);   // Allocate memory for the response and null terminate
    read(s, res, i);                // Read response

    printf("Response: %s\n", res);

    free(res);
    close(s);

    return 0;
}

Save the C source file above and cross compile it by utilizing MSCC SDK, and
then append its executable file upon a MFI image.

Run the script below to generate a MFI image containing an usr application.
`json_ipc.out`.

**NOTE**: Response is partially shown for space concern.

=== Custom Default Configuration

The default configuration of ENT switch products can be customized as well. In this
use case, we are going to assign a different default IP address 192.168.0.1 other
than MSCC factory default (DHCP).

Execute the script below to customize the default IP address.

.custom_default-config.sh

----

After executing the script, a new MFI image `<targeted

As we can see from the log, 192.168.0.1 becomes the default IP address every
time the user `reload default`.
