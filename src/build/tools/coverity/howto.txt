Install by copying from http://coverity.microchip.com:8080/
===========================================================

Make sure you have a license file "license.dat"

Click on "Help" in upper right corner
Click on "Downloads"
Click on "Select a package" on the bottom of the page
Pick one that matches your PC and click "Download"

Copy license.dat to /opt/coverity

Install the softwware in /opt/coverity 

First run
=========
Takes around 30 minutes on my old machine.

Better use an IStaX target, because that will probably generate most issues.

rbn@soft-dev14:.../build(master)$ make coverity-first

Copy files to a safe place:

rbn@soft-dev14:.../build(master)$ mkdir ~/temp
rbn@soft-dev14:.../build(master)$ cp -r obj/cov ~/temp

Now try to look at the report, through a browser. Open
~/temp/cov/cov-istax_arm_multi/html/index.html

This will contain ALL issues detected by Coverity. In this case this is 671.

coverity.microchip.com:8080
===========================

Use http://coverity.microchip.com:8080/#/project-view/12419/10076, which will
guide you directly to the WebStaX project.

Login with your M-number and password.

This is where you find the issues still to be resolved.

As of today, there are 219 issues to be looked at.

Find the ones you think you can solve and assign them to yourself (Owner).

Locate the issue in your precious "First run" report. It's there isn't it?

What should I fix?
==================

Back in the days, we used to dismiss a lot of Coverity issues, because they were
ignorable. This is the difference between the number of issues of your local run
minus the number of issues of Cov. Web = 671 - 219 = 452 bugs.

I think it's better to make Coverity *never* find these issues again, because if
we for some reason lose our Coverity database or change server or change company
name or (perhaps more important) a customer also runs Coverity on our code), we
(or the customer) can start all over again.

So for instance this code snippet:

  vtss_1588_tx_msg(announce->ptp_port->port_mask, &announce->ann_buf);

is reported by Coverity as "Unchecked return value".

You should change the code snippet to either check the return value and take
proper action or void the return value, like this:

   (void)vtss_1588_tx_msg(announce->ptp_port->port_mask, &announce->ann_buf);

(Notice that according to our coding guide lines, there's no space between
"(void)" and "vtss_1588..."

Time to check that it works:

Next runs
=========

With the issue fixed in source code, check that it's gone by running Coverity
locally.

The following will take the time it takes to compile the changed file and
dependencies plus the time it takes to create a new report. Typically less than
a minute.

rbn@soft-dev14:.../build$ make coverity-next

Committing
==========

If you have a CID from coverity.microchip.com:8080, then commit your changes as:
$ git commit -m "CC-<xyz>. <Module>: Fixed bla-bla-bla"

Then paste the SHA into the CID in Coverity.

The "CC-" prefix is legacy.

If you don't have a CID, then commit your changes as:
$ git commit -m "CC: <Module>: Fixed bla-bla-bla"
